["James Marshall Jimi Hendrix born Johnny Allen Hendrix November 27, 1942  September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist songwriter and singer. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years he is widely regarded as the greatest and one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.Born in Seattle Washington Hendrix began playing guitar at age 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward he moved to Clarksville then Nashville Tennessee and began playing gigs on the chitlin circuit earning a place in the Isley Brothers backing band and later with Little Richard with whom he continued to work through mid1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with his band the Jimi Hendrix Experience Hey Joe Purple Haze and The Wind Cries Mary. He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album Electric Ladyland reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrixs most commercially successful release and his only number one album. The worlds highestpaid rock musician he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbituraterelated asphyxia in September 1970.\nHendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tonealtering effects units in mainstream rock such as fuzz distortion Octavia wahwah and UniVibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly GeorgeWarren of Rolling Stone commented Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, Billboard named him the Artist of the Year and Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Disc and Music Echo honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, Guitar Player named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked the bands three studio albums Are You Experienced 1967) Axis Bold as Love 1967) and Electric Ladyland 1968) among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixthgreatest artist of all time. Hendrix was named the greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023.\n\nAncestry and childhood\nHendrix was of African American and alleged Cherokee descent. His paternal grandfather Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix was born in 1866 from an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny and a grain merchant from Urbana Ohio or Illinois one of the wealthiest men in the area at that time. Hendrixs paternal grandmother Zenora Nora Rose Moore was a former dancer and vaudeville performer who cofounded Fountain Chapel in Hogans Alley. Hendrix and Moore relocated to Vancouver Canada where they had a son they named James Allen Hendrix on June 10, 1919; the family called him Al.In 1941, after moving to Seattle Washington Al met Lucille Jeter 1925\u20131958) at a dance they married on March 31, 1942. Lucilles father Jimis maternal grandfather was Preston Jeter born 1875) whose mother was born in similar circumstances as Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix. Lucilles mother Clarice n\u00e9e Lawson had African American ancestors who had been enslaved people. Al who had been drafted by the US Army to serve in World War II left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding. Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle he was the first of Lucilles five children. In 1946, Johnnys parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix in honor of Al and his late brother Leon MarshallStationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrixs birth Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle. He spent two months locked up without trial and while in the stockade received a telegram announcing his sons birth. During Als threeyear absence Lucille struggled to raise their son. When Al was away Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends especially Lucilles sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the US Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later unable to find Lucille Al went to the Berkeley California home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ who had taken care of and attempted to adopt Hendrix this is where Al saw his son for the first timeAfter returning from service Al reunited with Lucille but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon born 1948) was close but precarious with Leon in and out of foster care they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon Hendrix had three younger siblings Joseph born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela in 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmothers. A shy and sensitive boy he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old his parents divorced the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.\n\nFirst instruments\nAt Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid1950s Hendrixs habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the schools social worker. After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a security blanket she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed and Al refused to buy him a guitarIn 1957, while helping his father with a sidejob Hendrix found a ukulele among the garbage they were removing from an older womans home. She told him that he could keep the instrument which had only one string. Learning by ear he played single notes following along to Elvis Presley songs particularly Hound Dog. By the age of 33, Hendrixs mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mothers funeral he instead gave them shots of whiskey and told them that was how men should deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending but did not graduate from Garfield High SchoolIn mid1958, at age 15, Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar for 5 equivalent to 53 in 2023). He played for hours daily watching others and learning from more experienced guitarists and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters BB. King Howlin Wolf and Robert Johnson. The first tune Hendrix learned to play was the television theme Peter Gunn. Around that time Hendrix jammed with boyhood friend Sammy Drain and his keyboardplaying brother.  In 1959, attending a concert by Hank Ballard  The Midnighters in Seattle Hendrix met the groups guitarist Billy Davis. Davis showed him some guitar licks and got him a short gig with the Midnighters. The two remained friends until Hendrixs death in 1970Soon after he acquired the acoustic guitar Hendrix formed his first band the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar he could barely be heard over the sound of the group. After about three months he realized that he needed an electric guitar. In mid1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrixs first gig was with an unnamed band in the Jaffe Room of Seattles Temple De Hirsch but they fired him between sets for showing off. He joined the Rocking Kings which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When his guitar was stolen after he left it backstage overnight Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.\n\nMilitary service\nBefore Hendrix was 19 years old law authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. Given a choice between prison or joining the Army he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord California he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell Kentucky. He arrived on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father Theres nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks then when you go to jump school ... you get hell. They work you to death fussing and fighting. In his next letter home Hendrix who had left his guitar in Seattle at the home of his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible stating I really need it now. His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had handpainted the words Betty Jean to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties which led to taunting and physical abuse from his peers who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return. In November 1961, fellow serviceman Billy Cox walked past an army club and heard Hendrix playing. Impressed by Hendrixs technique which Cox described as a combination of John Lee Hooker and Beethoven Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within weeks they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band the CasualsHendrix completed his paratrooper training and on January 11, 1962, Major General Charles W. G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch. By February his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrixs platoon sergeant James C. Spears filed a report in which he stated He has no interest whatsoever in the Army ... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible. On June 29, 1962, Hendrix was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump but no Army records have been produced that indicate that he received or was discharged for any injuries.\n\nCareer\nEarly years\nIn September 1962, after Cox was discharged from the Army he and Hendrix moved about 20 miles 32 km across the state line from Fort Campbell to Clarksville Tennessee and formed a band the King Kasuals. In Seattle Hendrix saw Butch Snipes play with his teeth and now the Kasuals second guitarist Alphonso Baby Boo Young was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged Hendrix also learned to play in this way. He later explained The idea of doing that came to me ... in Tennessee. Down there you have to play with your teeth or else you get shot. Theres a trail of broken teeth all over the stage.Although they began playing lowpaying gigs at obscure venues the band eventually moved to Nashvilles Jefferson Street which was the traditional heart of the citys black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town the Club del Morocco and for the next two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners Booking Association TOBA widely known as the chitlin circuit. In addition to playing in his own band Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul RB and blues musicians including Wilson Pickett Slim Harpo Sam Cooke Ike  Tina Turner and Jackie WilsonIn January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically and frustrated by having to follow the rules of bandleaders Hendrix decided to venture out on his own. He moved into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem where he befriended Lithofayne Pridgon known as Faye who became his girlfriend. A Harlem native with connections throughout the areas music scene Pridgon provided him with shelter support and encouragement. Hendrix also met the Allen twins Arthur and Albert. In February 1964, Hendrix won first prize in the Apollo Theater amateur contest. Hoping to secure a career opportunity he played the Harlem club circuit and sat in with various bands. At the recommendation of a former associate of Joe Tex Ronnie Isley granted Hendrix an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with the Isley Brothers backing band the IB. Specials which he readily accepted.\n\nFirst recordings\nIn March 1964, Hendrix recorded the twopart single Testify with the Isley Brothers. Released in June it failed to chart. In May he provided guitar instrumentation for the Don Covay song Mercy Mercy. Issued in August by Rosemart Records and distributed by Atlantic the track reached number 35 on the Billboard chartHendrix toured with the Isleys during much of 1964, but near the end of October after growing tired of playing the same set every night he left the band. Soon afterward Hendrix joined Little Richards touring band the Upsetters. During a stop in Los Angeles in February 1965, he recorded his first and only single with Richard I Dont Know What You Got But Its Got Me written by Don Covay and released by VeeJay Records. Richards popularity was waning at the time and the single peaked at number 92, where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart. Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single which included the Arthur Lee penned My Diary as the Aside and Utee as the Bside. Hendrix played guitar on both tracks which also included background vocals by Lee. The single failed to chart but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lees band LoveIn July 1965, Hendrix made his first television appearance on Nashvilles Channel 5 Night Train. Performing in Little Richards ensemble band he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on Shotgun. The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness wardrobe and Hendrixs stage antics and in late July Richards brother Robert fired himOn July 27, Hendrix signed his first recording contract with Juggy Murray at Sue Records and Copa Management. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers and recorded a second single with them Move Over and Let Me Dance backed with Have You Ever Been Disappointed. Later that year he joined a New Yorkbased RB band Curtis Knight and the Squires after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight monthsIn October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single How Would You Feel backed with Welcome Home. Despite his twoyear contract with Sue Hendrix signed a threeyear recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin on October 15. While the relationship with Chalpin was shortlived his contract remained in force which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpes twopart single Help Me. Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals Hornets Nest and Knock Yourself Out released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966Feeling restricted by his experiences as an RB sideman Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York Citys Greenwich Village which had a vibrant and diverse music scene. There he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June Jimmy James and the Blue Flames which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe Au Go Go in Manhattan as the backing group for a singer and guitarist then billed as John Hammond.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\nBy May 1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living wage playing the RB circuit so he briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires for an engagement at one of New York Citys most popular nightspots the Cheetah Club. During a performance Linda Keith the girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards noticed Hendrix and was mesmerised by his playing. She invited him to join her for a drink and the two became friendsWhile Hendrix was playing as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames Keith recommended him to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein. They failed to see Hendrixs musical potential and rejected him. Keith referred him to Chas Chandler who was leaving the Animals and was interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler saw Hendrix play in Cafe Wha a Greenwich Village New York City nightclub. Chandler liked the Billy Roberts song Hey Joe and was convinced he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrixs version of the song he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and exAnimals manager Michael Jeffery. That night Hendrix gave an impromptu solo performance at The Scotch of St James and began a relationship with Kathy Etchingham that lasted for two and a half years.\nFollowing Hendrixs arrival in London Chandler began recruiting members for a band designed to highlight his talents the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals where Reddings knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix. Another important criterion for Hendrix was fashionaccording to author Keith Shadwick what he really liked was Reddings hairstyle. Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrixs band Redding agreed. Chandler began looking for a drummer and soon after contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position he readily accepted. Chandler also convinced Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from Jimmy to the more exotic JimiOn October 1, 1966, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street where Cream was scheduled to perform and where Hendrix and guitarist Eric Clapton met. Clapton later said He asked if he could play a couple of numbers. I said Of course but I had a funny feeling about him. Halfway through Creams set Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin Wolf song Killing Floor. In 1989, Clapton described the performance He played just about every style you could think of and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks like playing with his teeth and behind his back but it wasnt in an upstaging sense at all and that was it ... He walked off and my life was never the same again.\n\nUK success\nIn midOctober 1966, Chandler arranged an engagement for the Experience as Johnny Hallydays supporting act during a brief tour of France. Thus the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed their first show on October 13, 1966, at the Novelty in Evreux. Their enthusiastically received 15-minute performance at the Olympia theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band. In late October Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp managers of the Who signed the Experience to their newly formed label Track Records and the group recorded their first song Hey Joe on October 23. Stone Free which was Hendrixs first songwriting effort after arriving in England was recorded on November 2.\nFrom November 8 to 11, 1966, The Jimi Hendrix Experience had a short residency at the Big Apple club in Munich their first gigs in Germany. At this occasion Hendrix had a show experience that would define him from then on when trying to escape in panic from a frenetic audience that had pulled him off the stage he smashed his guitar for the first time in a sound explosion on stage which was perceived by the audience as part of the show. Observing the audiences reaction Chandler decided that this show of violence had to become a permanent feature of the Experiences showIn midNovember they performed at the Bag ONails nightclub in London with Clapton John Lennon Paul McCartney Jeff Beck Pete Townshend Brian Jones Mick Jagger and Kevin Ayers in attendance. Ayers described the crowds reaction as stunned disbelief All the stars were there and I heard serious comments you know shit Jesus damn and other words worse than that. The performance earned Hendrix his first interview published in Record Mirror with the headline Mr. Phenomenon. Now hear this ... we predict that Hendrix is going to whirl around the business like a tornado wrote Bill Harry who asked the rhetorical question Is that full big swinging sound really being created by only three people? Hendrix said We dont want to be classed in any category ... If it must have a tag Id like it to be called Free Feeling. Its a mixture of rock freakout rave and blues. Through a distribution deal with Polydor Records the Experiences first single Hey Joe backed with Stone Free was released on December 16, 1966.  After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go! and Top of the Pops Hey Joe entered the UK charts on December 29 and peaked at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit Purple Haze and in May with The Wind Cries Mary which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks peaking at number six. On March 12, 1967, he performed at the Troutbeck Hotel Ilkley West Yorkshire where after about 900 people turned up the hotel was licensed for 250) the local police stopped the gig due to safety concernsOn March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the bands media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked Maybe I can smash up an elephant to which Altham replied Well its a pity you cant set fire to your guitar. Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire at the end of a 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt members of Londons press labeled Hendrix the Black Elvis and the Wild Man of Borneo.An enduring urban legend in the UK maintains that a possible explanation for the feral parakeets that have appeared in Great Britain since the mid20th century may derive from a single pair of the birds that were released by Hendrix on Carnaby Street in the 1960s. According to a study however which mapped historical news reports of sightings of the birds the myth is not true.\n\nAre You Experienced\nAfter the UK chart success of their first two singles Hey Joe and Purple Haze the Experience began assembling material for a fulllength LP. In London recording began at De Lane Lea Studios and later moved to the prestigious Olympic Studios. The album Are You Experienced features a diversity of musical styles including blues tracks such as Red House and the RB song Remember. It also included the experimental science fiction piece Third Stone from the Sun and the postmodern soundscapes of the title track with prominent backwards guitar and drums. I Dont Live Today served as a medium for Hendrixs guitar feedback improvisation and Fire was driven by Mitchells drummingReleased in the UK on May 12, 1967, Are You Experienced spent 33 weeks on the charts peaking at number two. It was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. On June 4, 1967, Hendrix opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with his rendition of Sgt. Peppers title track which was released just three days previous. Beatles manager Brian Epstein owned the Saville at the time and both George Harrison and Paul McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing Sgt. Pepper. Its a pretty major compliment in anyones book. I put that down as one of the great honors of my career. Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records Are You Experienced reached number five on the Billboard 200In 1989, Noe Goldwasser the founding editor of Guitar World described Are You Experienced as the album that shook the world ... leaving it forever changed. In 2005, Rolling Stone called the doubleplatinum LP Hendrixs epochal debut and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time noting his exploitation of amp howl and characterizing his guitar playing as incendiary ... historic in itself.\n\nMonterey Pop Festival\nAlthough popular in Europe at the time the Experiences first US single Hey Joe failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. Their fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix whom he called an absolute ace on the guitar. McCartney agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in midJuneOn June 18, 1967, introduced by Brian Jones as the most exciting performer he had ever heard Hendrix opened with a fast arrangement of Howlin Wolfs song Killing Floor wearing what Shadwick described as clothes as exotic as any on display elsewhere. Shadwick wrote Hendrix was not only something utterly new musically but an entirely original vision of what a black American entertainer should and could look like. The Experience went on to perform renditions of Hey Joe BB. Kings Rock Me Baby Chip Taylors Wild Thing and Bob Dylans Like a Rolling Stone and four original compositions Foxy Lady Can You See Me The Wind Cries Mary and Purple Haze. The set ended with Hendrix destroying his guitar and tossing pieces of it out to the audience. Rolling Stones Alex Vadukul wrote\n\nWhen Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival he created one of rocks most perfect moments. Standing in the front row of that concert was a 17-yearold boy named Ed Caraeff. Caraeff had never seen Hendrix before nor heard his music but he had a camera with him and there was one shot left in his roll of film. As Hendrix lit his guitar Caraeff took a final photo. It would become one of the most famous images in rock and roll.\nCaraeff stood on a chair next to the edge of the stage and took four monochrome pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera to protect his face from the heat. Rolling Stone later colorized the image matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland the final frame of Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar hands raised is one of the most famous images in rock. Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote that Hendrixs burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention. The Los Angeles Times asserted that upon leaving the stage Hendrix graduated from rumor to legend. Author John McDermott wrote that Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what theyd just heard and seen. According to Hendrix I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar. The performance was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker and included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the US publicAfter the festival the Experience was booked for five concerts at Bill Grahams Fillmore with Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience outperformed Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights and replaced them at the top of the bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction which included a free openair concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go the Experience was booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. The Monkees requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans but their young audience disliked the Experience who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later said he engineered the tour to gain publicity for Hendrix.\n\nAxis Bold as Love\nThe second Experience album Axis Bold as Love opens with the track EXP which uses microphonic and harmonic feedback in a new creative fashion. It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrixs guitar move through the stereo image revolving around the listener. The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space. He composed the albums title track and finale around two verses and two choruses during which he pairs emotions with personas comparing them to colors. The songs coda features the first recording of stereo phasing. Shadwick described the composition as possibly the most ambitious piece on Axis the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence in Hendrixs songwriting. His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion with tremolopicked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played. The track fades out on tremolopicked 32nd note double stopsThe scheduled release date for Axis was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming Hendrix Chandler and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of If 6 Was 9\". Redding had a tape recording of this mix which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having remixed the album so quickly and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more timeAxis featured psychedelic cover art that depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various avatars of Vishnu incorporating a painting of them by Roger Law from a photoportrait by Karl Ferris. The painting was then superimposed on a copy of a massproduced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover which Track spent 5,000 producing would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He said You got it wrong ... Im not that kind of Indian. Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, Axis Bold as Love reached number three in the USWhile author and journalist Richie Unterberger described Axis as the least impressive Experience album according to author Peter Doggett the release heralded a new subtlety in Hendrixs work. Mitchell said Axis was the first time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board as well as playing and had some positive ideas of how he wanted things recorded. It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio.\n\nElectric Ladyland\nRecording for the Experiences third and final studio album Electric Ladyland began as early as December 20, 1967, at Olympic Studios. Several songs were attempted however in April 1968, the Experience with Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren moved the sessions to the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York. As the sessions progressed Chandler became increasingly frustrated with Hendrixs perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes. Hendrix also allowed numerous friends and guests to join them in the studio which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Redding later recalled There were tons of people in the studio you couldnt move. It was a party not a session. Redding who had formed his own band in mid1968, Fat Mattress found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience so Hendrix played many of the bass parts on Electric Ladyland. The albums cover stated that it was produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix.\nDuring the Electric Ladyland recording sessions Hendrix began experimenting with other combinations of musicians including Jefferson Airplanes Jack Casady and Traffics Steve Winwood who played bass and organ respectively on the 15-minute slowblues jam Voodoo Chile. During the albums production Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with BB. King Al Kooper and Elvin Bishop. Electric Ladyland was released on October 25, and by midNovember it had reached number one in the US spending two weeks at the top spot. The double LP was Hendrixs most commercially successful release and his only number one album. It peaked at number six in the UK spending 12 weeks on the chart. Electric Ladyland included Hendrixs cover of a Bob Dylan song All Along the Watchtower which became Hendrixs highestselling single and his only US top 40 hit peaking at number 20; the single reached number five in the UK. Burning of the Midnight Lamp his first recorded song to feature a wahwah pedal was added to the album. It was originally released as his fourth single in the UK in August 1967 and reached number 18 on the chartsIn 1989, Noe Goldwasser the founding editor of Guitar World described Electric Ladyland as Hendrixs masterpiece. According to author Michael Heatley most critics agree that the album is the fullest realization of Jimis farreaching ambitions. In 2004, author Peter Doggett wrote For pure experimental genius melodic flair conceptual vision and instrumental brilliance Electric Ladyland remains a prime contender for the status of rocks greatest album. Doggett described the LP as a display of musical virtuosity never surpassed by any rock musician.\n\nBreakup of the Experience\nIn January 1969, after an absence of more than six months Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchinghams apartment in Brook Street London next door to the home of the composer Handel. After a performance of Voodoo Child on BBCs Happening for Lulu show in January 1969, the band stopped midway through an attempt at their first hit Hey Joe and then launched into an instrumental version of Sunshine of Your Love as a tribute to the recently disbanded band Cream until director and producer Stanley Dorfman was forced to bring the song to a premature end. The Experience bass player Noel Redding describes in his autobiography as the minutes ticked by on his live show short of running onto the set to stop us or pulling the plug there was nothing he could do. We played past the point where Lulu might have joined us played through the time for talking at the end played through Stanley tearing his hair pointing to his watch and silently screaming at us. We played out the show..Afterwards Dorfman refused to speak to us but the result is one of the most widely used bits of film we ever did. Certainly its the most relaxed. Dorfman recalls at the BBC club after the show he found Hendrix to be a very sweet man very quiet he didnt know hed done anything wrong at all. However according to rock and roll legend Hendrix was banned from working at the BBC again. During this time the Experience toured Scandinavia West Germany and gave their final two performances in France. On February 18 and 24, they played soldout concerts at Londons Royal Albert Hall which were the last European appearances of this lineupBy February 1969, Redding had grown weary of Hendrixs unpredictable work ethic and his creative control over the Experiences music. During the previous months European tour interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions On the first day as I nearly expected there was nothing doing ... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours came back and it was still ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued ... On the last day I just watched it happen for a while and then went back to my flat. The last Experience sessions that included Reddinga rerecording of Stone Free for use as a possible single releasetook place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21The last performance of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Feys Denver Pop Festival a threeday event held at Denvers Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue in the back of a rental truck which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career blaming Hendrixs plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later said Mitch and I hung out a lot together but were English. If wed go out Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard getting too tired and taking too many drugs ... I liked Hendrix. I dont like Mitchell.Soon after Reddings departure Hendrix began lodging at the eightbedroom Ashokan House in the hamlet of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York where he had spent some time vacationing in mid1969. Manager Michael Jeffery arranged the accommodations in the hope that the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery which included Hendrixs first appearance on US TVon The Dick Cavett Showwhere he was backed by the studio orchestra and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.\n\nWoodstock\nBy 1969, Hendrix was the worlds highestpaid rock musician. In August he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that included many of the most popular bands of the time. For the concert he added rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and conga players Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez. The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance and according to Mitchell they never connected musically. Before arriving at the engagement Hendrix heard reports that the size of the audience had grown enormously which concerned him as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds. He was an important draw for the event and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee he was the festivals highestpaid performerHendrix decided to move his midnight Sunday slot to Monday morning closing the show. The band took the stage around 8:00 am by which time Hendrix had been awake for more than three days. The audience which peaked at an estimated 400,000 people was reduced to 30,000. The festival MC Chip Monck introduced the group as the Jimi Hendrix Experience but Hendrix clarified We decided to change the whole thing around and call it Gypsy Sun and Rainbows. For short its nothin but a Band of Gypsys.\n\nHendrixs performance included a rendition of the US national anthem The StarSpangled Banner with copious feedback distortion and sustain to imitate the sounds made by rockets and bombs. Contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the Vietnam War. Three weeks later Hendrix said Were all Americans ... it was like Go America!... We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static see. Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film Woodstock Hendrixs version became part of the sixties zeitgeist. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the New York Post wrote It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties. Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a bluebeaded white leather jacket with fringe a red headscarf and blue jeans are regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played Hey Joe during the encore concluding the 31\u20442-day festival. Upon leaving the stage he collapsed from exhaustion. In 2011, the editors of Guitar World named his performance of The StarSpangled Banner the greatest performance of all time.\n\nBand of Gypsys\nA legal dispute arose in 1966 regarding a record contract that Hendrix had entered into the previous year with producer Ed Chalpin. After two years of litigation the parties agreed to a resolution that granted Chalpin the distribution rights to an album of original Hendrix material. Hendrix decided that they would record the LP Band of Gypsys during two live appearances. In preparation for the shows he formed an allblack power trio with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles formerly with Wilson Pickett the Electric Flag and the Buddy Miles Express. Critic John Rockwell described Hendrix and Miles as jazzrock fusionists and their collaboration as pioneering. Others identified a funk and soul influence in their music. Concert promoter Bill Graham called the shows the most brilliant emotional display of virtuoso electric guitar that he had ever heard. Biographers have speculated that Hendrix formed the band in an effort to appease members of the Black Power movement and others in the black communities who called for him to use his fame to speak up for civil rights.\n\nHendrix had been recording with Cox since April and jamming with Miles since September and the trio wrote and rehearsed material which they performed at a series of four shows over two nights on December 31 and January 1, at the Fillmore East. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP which was produced by Hendrix. The album includes the track Machine Gun which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of Hendrixs career and the premiere example of his unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist ... In this performance Jimi transcended the medium of rock music and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar. During the songs extended instrumental breaks Hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare including rockets bombs and diving planesThe Band of Gypsys album was the only official live Hendrix LP made commercially available during his lifetime several tracks from the Woodstock and Monterey shows were released later that year. The album was released in April 1970 by Capitol Records it reached the top ten in both the US and the UK. That same month a single was issued with Stepping Stone as the Aside and Izabella as the Bside but Hendrix was dissatisfied with the quality of the mastering and he demanded that it be withdrawn and remixed preventing the songs from charting and resulting in Hendrixs least successful single it was also his lastOn January 28, 1970, a third and final Band of Gypsys appearance took place they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the antiVietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the Winter Festival for Peace. American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert he recalled Hendrix came in with his head down sat on the couch alone and put his head in his hands ... He didnt move until it was time for the show. Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for Foxy Lady. He then began playing Earth Blues before telling the audience Thats what happens when earth fucks with space. Moments later he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit ending the Band of Gypsys.\n\nCry of Love Tour\nSoon after the abruptly ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix Mitchell and Redding were interviewed by Rolling Stone in February 1970 as a united group Hendrix never intended to work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a reformed Experience he was told that he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with Rolling Stones Keith Altham Hendrix defended the decision Its nothing personal against Noel but we finished what we were doing with the Experience and Billys style of playing suits the new group better. Although an official name was never adopted for the lineup of Hendrix Mitchell and Cox promoters often billed them as the Jimi Hendrix Experience or just Jimi HendrixDuring the first half of 1970, Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP. Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as The Cry of Love. He had started writing songs for the album in 1968, but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned. Soon afterward he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the LA. Forum performing for 20,000 people. Setlists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material. Several shows were recorded and they produced some of Hendrixs most memorable live performances. At one of them the second Atlanta International Pop Festival on July 4, he played to the largest American audience of his career. According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz as many as 500,000 people attended the concert. On July 17, they appeared at the New York Pop Festival Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show and the set was considered a disaster. The American leg of the tour which included 32 performances ended in Honolulu Hawaii on August 1, 1970. This would be Hendrixs final concert appearance in the US.\n\nElectric Lady Studios\nIn 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly invested in the purchase of the Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment but when an audit of Hendrixs expenses revealed that he had incurred exorbitant fees by blockbooking recording studios for lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided to convert the building  into a studio of his own. Hendrix could then work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures which had reached a reported 300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows an ambient lighting machine and a psychedelic mural Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrixs creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted with their total investment estimated at 1 millionHendrix first used Electric Lady on June 15, 1970, when he jammed with Steve Winwood and Chris Wood of Traffic the next day he recorded his first track there Night Bird Flying. The studio officially opened for business on August 25, and a grand opening party was held the following day. Immediately afterwards Hendrix left for England he never returned to the States. He boarded an Air India flight for London with Cox joining Mitchell for a performance as the headlining act of the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1970.\n\nEuropean tour\nWhen the European leg of the Cry of Love tour began Hendrix was longing for his new studio and creative outlet and was not eager to fulfill the commitment. On September 2, 1970, he abandoned a performance in Aarhus after three songs stating Ive been dead a long time. Four days later he gave his final concert appearance at the Isle of Fehmarn Festival in West Germany. He was met with booing and jeering from fans in response to his cancellation of a show slated for the end of the previous nights bill due to torrential rain and risk of electrocution. Immediately following the festival Hendrix Mitchell and Cox traveled to LondonThree days after the performance Cox who was suffering from severe paranoia after either taking LSD or being given it unknowingly quit the tour and went to stay with his parents in Pennsylvania. Within days of Hendrixs arrival in England he had spoken with Chas Chandler Alan Douglas and others about leaving his manager Michael Jeffery. On September 16, Hendrix performed in public for the last time during an informal jam at Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club in Soho with Eric Burdon and his latest band War. They began by playing a few of their recent hits and after a brief intermission Hendrix joined them during Mother Earth and Tobacco Road. He died less than 48 hours later.\n\nDrugs and alcohol\nHendrix entered a small club in Clarksville Tennessee in July 1962, drawn in by live music. He stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the 400 equivalent to 4,029 in 2023) that he had saved during his time in the Army. I went in this jazz joint and had a drink he explained. I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish goodnatured sometimes. Anyway I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I came out of that place with sixteen dollars left. Alcohol eventually became the scourge of his existence driving him to fits of pique even rare bursts of atypical physical violence.\n\nRoby and Schreiber assert that Hendrix first used LSD when he met Linda Keith in late 1966. Shapiro and Glebbeek however assert that Hendrix used it in June 1967 at the earliest while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keiths New York apartment. One of Keiths friends offered Hendrix acid a street name for LSD but Hendrix asked for LSD instead showing what Cross describes as his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics. Before that Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs including cannabis hashish amphetamines and occasionally cocaine. After 1967, he regularly used cannabis hashish LSD and amphetamines particularly while touring. According to Cross few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi.\n\nDrug abuse and violence\nWhen Hendrix drank to excess or mixed drugs with alcohol often he became angry and violent. His friend Herbie Worthington said Hendrix simply turned into a bastard when he drank. According to friend Sharon Lawrence liquor set off a bottledup anger a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise.In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden to start a oneweek tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day Hendrix got into a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen in Gothenburg smashing a plateglass window and injuring his right hand for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fineIn 1969, Hendrix rented a house in Benedict Canyon California that was burglarized. Later while under the influence of drugs and alcohol he accused his friend Paul Caruso of the theft threw punches and stones at him and chased him away from his house. A few days later Hendrix hit his girlfriend Carmen Borrero above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken jealous rage and gave her a cut that required stitches.\n\nCanadian drug charges and trial\nHendrix was passing through customs at Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, when authorities found a small amount of heroin and hashish in his luggage and charged him with drug possession. He was released on 10,000 bail equivalent to 83,085 in 2023) and was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months leading up to his December 1969 trial. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew that the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication which he put in his bag. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto both men also stated that they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrixs bag without his knowledge.\n\nDeath postmortem and burial\nDetails concerning Hendrixs last day and death are disputed. He spent much of September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann the only witness to his final hours.  Dannemann said that she prepared a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel around 11 pm when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove him to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45 am where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 am. She said that they talked until around 7 am when they went to sleep. Dannemann awoke around 11 am. and found Hendrix breathing but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 am and it arrived nine minutes later. Paramedics transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbots Hospital where doctor John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45 pm. on September 18Coroner Gavin Thurston ordered a postmortem examination which was performed on September 21 by Robert Donald Teare a forensic pathologist. Thurston completed the inquest on September 28 and concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Citing insufficient evidence of the circumstances he declared an open verdict. Dannemann later revealed that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets 18 times the recommended dosageDesmond Henley embalmed Hendrixs body which was flown to Seattle on September 29. Hendrixs family and friends held a service at Dunlap Baptist Church in Seattles Rainier Valley on Thursday October 1; his body was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in nearby Renton the location of his mothers grave. Family and friends traveled in 24 limousines and more than 200 people attended the funeral including Mitch Mitchell Noel Redding Miles Davis John Hammond and Johnny WinterHendrix is often cited as one example of an allegedly disproportionate number of musicians dying at age 27, including Brian Jones Alan Wilson Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin in the same era a phenomenon referred to as the 27 Club.\n\nUnauthorized and posthumous releases\nBy 1967, as Hendrix was gaining in popularity many of his preExperience recordings were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix. The recordings which came under the control of producer Ed Chalpin of PPX with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965, were often remixed between their repeated reissues and licensed to record companies such as Decca and Capitol. Hendrix publicly denounced the releases describing them as malicious and greatly inferior stating At PPX we spent on average about one hour recording a song. Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song. These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue amounting to hundreds of albumsSome of Hendrixs unfinished fourth studio album was released as the 1971 title The Cry of Love. Although the album reached number three in the US and number two in the UK producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that they were unable to make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971's Rainbow Bridge still others were issued on 1972's War Heroes. Material from The Cry of Love was rereleased in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include. Four years after Hendrixs death producer Alan Douglas acquired the rights to produce unreleased music by Hendrix he attracted criticism for using studio musicians to replace or add tracksIn 1993, MCA Records delayed a multimilliondollar sale of Hendrixs publishing copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement. He acknowledged that he had sold distribution rights to a foreign corporation in 1974, but stated that it did not include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue. Under a settlement reached in July 1995, Al Hendrix regained control of his sons song and image rights.  He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the familyrun company Experience Hendrix LLC formed in 1995. In August 2009, Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainments Legacy Recordings division to take effect in 2010. Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010 Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project starting with the release of Valleys of Neptune in March of that year. In the months before his death Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled Black Gold now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC but it has not been released.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nHendrix played a variety of guitars but was most prominently associated with the Fender Stratocaster. He acquired his first in 1966, when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used Stratocaster built around 1964. He used it often during performances and recordings. In 1967, he described the Stratocaster as the best allaround guitar for the stuff were doing he praised its bright treble and deep bass.Hendrix mainly played righthanded guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for lefthand playing. Because of the slant of the Stratocasters bridge pickup his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound the opposite of the intended design. Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters Duosonics two different Gibson Flying Vs a Gibson Les Paul three Gibson SGs a Gretsch Corvette and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.\n\nAmplifiers\nDuring 1965 and 1966, while Hendrix was playing backup for soul and RB acts in the US he used an 85-watt Fender Twin Reverb amplifier. When Chandler brought Hendrix to England in October 1966, he supplied him with 30-watt Burns amps which Hendrix thought were too small for his needs. After an early London gig when he was unable to use his Fender Twin he asked about the Marshall amps he had noticed other groups using. Years earlier Mitch Mitchell had taken drum lessons from Marshall founder Jim Marshall and he introduced Hendrix to Marshall. At their initial meeting Hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100-watt Super Lead amplifiers he grew accustomed to using all three in unison. The equipment arrived on October 11, 1966, and the Experience used it during their first tourMarshall amps were important to the development of Hendrixs overdriven sound and his use of feedback creating what author Paul Trynka described as a definitive vocabulary for rock guitar. Hendrix usually turned all the control knobs to the maximum level which became known as the Hendrix setting. During the four years prior to his death he purchased between 50 and 100 Marshall amplifiers. Jim Marshall said Hendrix was the greatest ambassador his company ever had.\n\nEffects\nOne of Hendrixs signature effects was the wahwah pedal which he first heard used with an electric guitar in Creams Tales of Brave Ulysses released in May 1967. That July while performing at the Scene club in New York City Hendrix met Frank Zappa whose band the Mothers of Invention were performing at the adjacent Garrick Theater. Hendrix was fascinated by Zappas application of the pedal and he experimented with one later that evening. He used a wah pedal during the opening to Voodoo Child Slight Return creating one of the bestknown wahwah riffs of the classic rock era. He also uses the effect on Up from the Skies Little Miss Lover and Still Raining Still Dreaming.Hendrix used a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face and a Vox wah pedal during recording sessions and performances but also experimented with other guitar effects. He enjoyed a fruitful longterm collaboration with electronics enthusiast Roger Mayer whom he once called the secret of his sound. Mayer introduced him to the Octavia an octavedoubling effect pedal in December 1966, and he first recorded with it during the guitar solo to Purple Haze.Hendrix also used the UniVibe designed to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating Leslie speaker. He uses the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track Machine Gun which prominently features the Univibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face. For performances he plugged his guitar into the wahwah which was connected to the Fuzz Face then the UniVibe and finally a Marshall amplifier.\n\nInfluences\nAs an adolescent in the 1950s Hendrix became interested in rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley Little Richard and Chuck Berry. In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters Elmore James and B. B. King inspired him during the beginning of his career he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware he said I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and it scared me to death because I heard all of these sounds. In 1970, he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville the television show the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nCox stated that during their time serving in the US military he and Hendrix primarily listened to southern blues artists such as Jimmy Reed and Albert King. According to Cox King was a very very powerful influence. Howlin Wolf also inspired Hendrix who performed Wolfs Killing Floor as the opening song of his US debut at the Monterey Pop Festival. The influence of soul artist Curtis Mayfield can be heard in Hendrixs guitar playing and the influence of Bob Dylan can be heard in Hendrixs songwriting he was known to play Dylans records repeatedly particularly Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde.\n\nLegacy\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography for the Experience states Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive technical ability and creative application of such effects as wahwah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll. Musicologist Andy Aledort described Hendrix as one of the most creative and influential musicians that has ever lived. Music journalist Chuck Philips wrote In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians Hendrix has served as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s.Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback and helped to popularize use of the wahwah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb. He applied this technique during the beginning bars of Little Wing which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style with the thumb playing what a pianists left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing. He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings. Holly GeorgeWarren of Rolling Stone wrote Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style Hendrix synthesized diverse genres including blues RB soul British rock American folk music 1950s rock and roll and jazz. Musicologist David Moskowitz emphasized the importance of blues music in Hendrixs playing style and according to authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber He explored the outer reaches of psychedelic rock. His influence is evident in a variety of popular music formats and he has contributed significantly to the development of hard rock heavy metal funk postpunk grunge and hip hop music. His lasting influence on modern guitar players is difficult to overstate his techniques and delivery have been abundantly imitated by others. Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism he was a prolific recording artist who left behind numerous unreleased recordings. More than 40 years after his death Hendrix remains as popular as ever with annual album sales exceeding that of any year during his lifetimeAs with his contemporary Sly Stone Hendrix embraced the experimentalism of white musicians in progressive rock in the late 1960s and inspired a wave of progressive soul musicians that emerged by the next decade. He has directly influenced numerous funk and funk rock artists including Prince George Clinton John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic and Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers. Hendrix influenced postpunk guitarists such as John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Robert Smith of The Cure. Grunge guitarists such as Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Mike McCready and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam have cited Hendrix as an influence. Hendrixs influence also extends to many hip hop artists including De La Soul A Tribe Called Quest Digital Underground Beastie Boys and RunDMC. Miles Davis was deeply impressed by Hendrix and he compared Hendrixs improvisational abilities with those of saxophonist John Coltrane. Desert blues artists from the Sahara desert region including Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen have also acknowledged Hendrixs influenceRock and roll fans still debate whether Hendrix actually said that Chicago cofounder Terry Kath was a better guitar player than him but Kath named Hendrix as a major influence But then there was Hendrix man. Jimi was really the last cat to freak me. Jimi was playing all the stuff I had in my head. I couldnt believe it when I first heard him. Man no one can ever do what he did with a guitar. No one can ever take his place.Hendrix also influenced Black Sabbath industrial artist Marilyn Manson blues musician Stevie Ray Vaughan \nRandy HansenUli Jon Roth Kisss Ace Frehley Metallicas Kirk Hammett Aerosmiths Brad Whitford Judas Priests Richie Faulkner instrumental rock guitarist Joe Satriani Kings X singerbassist Doug Pinnick Adrian Belew and heavy metal virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen who said Hendrix created modern electric playing without question ... He was the first. He started it all. The rest is history. For many Hendrix was the preeminent black rocker according to Jon Caramanica. Members of the Soulquarians an experimental black music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s were influenced by the creative freedom in Hendrixs music and extensively used Electric Lady Studios to work on their own music.\n\nRecognition and awards\nHendrix received several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year. In 1968, Rolling Stone declared him the Performer of the Year. Also in 1968, the City of Seattle gave him the keys to the city.

In Seattle November 27, 1992, which would have been Hendrixs 50th birthday was made Jimi Hendrix Day largely due to the efforts of his boyhood friend guitarist Sammy DrainThe blue plaque identifying Hendrixs former residence at 23 Brook Street London was the first issued by English Heritage to commemorate a pop star. Next door is the former residence of George Frideric Handel 25 Brook Street which opened to the public as the Handel House Museum in 2001. From 2016 the museum made use of the upper floors of 23 for displays about Hendrix and was rebranded as Handel  Hendrix in London.\nA memorial statue of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster stands near the corner of Broadway and Pine Streets in Seattle. In May 2006, the city renamed a park near its Central District Jimi Hendrix Park in his honor.  In 2012, an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron Georgia. The marker text reads in part Over thirty musical acts performed including rock icon Jimi Hendrix playing to the largest American audience of his career.Hendrixs music has received a number of Hall of Fame Grammy awards starting with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992, followed by two Grammys in 1999 for his albums Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland Axis Bold as Love received a Grammy in 2006.

He was the guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Van Halen which he founded with his brother Alex in 1972. Van Halen also provided backing vocals for both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar and occasionally played the keyboard.\nVan Halen is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitarists in rock history and was wellknown for popularizing the tapping guitar technique allowing rapid arpeggios to be played with two hands on the fretboard. Rolling Stone named Van Halen the 4th greatest guitarist of all time in its The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2023Van Halen dealt with numerous health issues since the 1990s. He died in October 2020 due to complications from throat cancer.\n\nEarly life\nEdward Lodewijk Van Halen was born in Amsterdam on January 26, 1955, the son of Jan van Halen and Eugenia n\u00e9e van Beers. His father was a Dutch jazz pianist clarinettist and saxophonist while his mother was an Indo Eurasian woman from Rangkasbitung on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies now Indonesia. The family eventually settled in Nijmegen NetherlandsAfter experiencing mistreatment for their mixedrace relationship in the 1950s the parents moved the family to the US. in 1962. They settled near other family members in Pasadena California where Eddie and his brother Alex attended a segregated elementary school. Since the boys did not speak English as a first language they were considered minority students and experienced bullying by white students. They began learning the piano at age six commuting from Pasadena to San Pedro Los Angeles to study with an elderly piano teacher Stasys KalvaitisVan Halen was never taught to read music instead he watched recitals of Bach or Mozart repertoire and improvised. Between 1964 and 1967, he won first place in the annual piano competition at Long Beach City College. His parents wanted the boys to be classical pianists but Van Halen gravitated towards rock music and was greatly influenced by 1960s British Invasion bands like the Beatles and the Dave Clark Five. Consequently when Alex began playing the guitar Eddie bought a drum kit however after he heard Alexs performance of the Surfaris drum solo on the song Wipe Out he gave Alex the drums and began learning the electric guitar. According to him as a teen he often practiced while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door lockedEddie and Alex formed their first band with three other boys called themselves The Broken Combs and performed at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena when he was in the fourth grade. He later cited this performance as key to his desire to become a professional musician. He described supergroup Creams Im So Glad on the album Goodbye as mindblowing. He once claimed that he had learned almost all of Eric Claptons solos in the band Cream note for note. Ive always said Eric Clapton was my main influence he said but Jimmy Page was actually more the way I am in a recklessabandon kind of way. Speaking at an event at the Smithsonians National Museum of American History in 2015, Van Halen discussed his life and the American Dream saying We came here with approximately 50 and a piano and we didnt speak the language. Now look where we are. If thats not the American dream what is?\n\nCareer\nVan Halen band\nEddie and his brother Alex formed the band Mammoth in 1972. Two years later David Lee Roth joined Mammoth as lead singer and Mammoth officially changed its name to Van Halen and became a staple of the Los Angeles music scene playing at wellknown clubs such as the Whisky a Go GoAt a 1976 concert at The Starwood in California the band opened for UFO. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons saw the performance and said I was waiting backstage by the third song. He asked the band about their plans and they said There is a yogurt manufacturer that is going to invest in us. Gene begged them not to go that route and invited them to record some demos at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village in New York City. Gene then signed them to his company and the band recorded early demos of their songs including Runnin with the Devil. Excited about the band Gene approached Kiss manager Bill Aucoin and Kiss frontman Paul Stanley about them but they dismissed his desire to sign them to Aucoins management fold. Stanley later said he rejected Van Halen to protect Kiss and that they made an effort to make Gene drop the band to keep Gene in check. The discouraging words caused Gene to rip up the contract and he let them go after feeling he may have held the band back.\nThe next year Warner Records offered Van Halen a recording contractEddie remained on good terms with Gene. It was rumored that Eddie nearly replaced guitarist Ace Frehley after his departure from Kiss in 1982, but that Gene talked him out of leaving Van Halen. However neither Paul Stanley nor Eddie Van Halen remember this happening. Stanley does remember Eddie coming down to the studio being blown away by their song Creatures of the Night and telling Stanley he wanted to get into playing keyboards. Stanley was confused at Eddies interest in keyboards but his interest resulted in the creation of Jump.The bands 1978 album Van Halen reached 19 on the Billboard pop music charts and was one of rocks most commercially successful debuts highly regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album. By the early 1980s Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the timeEddie recorded the solo on the Michael Jackson song Beat It when The Who guitarist Pete Townshend became unavailable and recommended him. Eddie met with Quincy Jones and Jackson. Unsure of what he could add to a pop song he played along with the song and ended up restructuring it and adding the classic solo. In a 2012 CNN interview he said I listened to the song and I immediately go Can I change some parts? I turned to the engineer and I go OK from the breakdown chop in this part go to this piece prechorus to the chorus out. Took him maybe 10 minutes to put it together. And I proceeded to improvise two solos over it. He added I was just finishing the second solo when Michael walked in. And you know artists are kind of crazy people. Were all a little bit strange. I didnt know how he would react to what I was doing. So I warned him before he listened. I said Look I changed the middle section of your song. Now in my mind hes either going to have his bodyguards kick me out for butchering his song or hes going to like it. And so he gave it a listen and he turned to me and went Wow thank you so much for having the passion to not just come in and blaze a solo but to actually care about the song and make it better. Eddie was so pleased he refused payment for his work. Ironically Jacksons Thriller went to the 1 spot on the charts pushing Van Halens album 1984 to 2. 1984 went fivetimes Platinum a year after its release. Its lead single Jump became the bands first and only 1 pop hit and brought them a Grammy nominationThe band won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocals for the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. In 2019, the band ranked 20th on the RIAA list of bestselling artists with 56 million album sales in the United States and more than 100 million worldwide. Additionally Van Halen charted 13 numberone hits in the history of Billboards Mainstream Rock chart meanwhile VH1 ranked the band seventh on a list of the top 100 hard rock artists of all time and in 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Individually Van Halen received acclaim for his guitar work in the band.\n\nOther work\nVan Halen engaged in several projects outside of his band including solo work and partnerships with his brother on film soundtracks such as The Wild Life Twister and Sacred Sin as well as musical collaborations with Kiss bassist Gene Simmons singersongwriter Nicolette Larson Queen guitarist Brian May Sammy Hagar Black Sabbath Roger Waters Toto guitarist Steve Lukather and LL Cool J. In 1982, he contributed the guitar solo to Beat It for Michael Jacksons Thriller which became the biggest selling album of all time. In addition Van Halen made cameo appearances in the music video for Frank Sinatras LA. Is My Lady an episode of Caf\u00e9 Americain starring his thenwife Valerie Bertinelli and an episode of Two and a Half Men.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nHis first guitar purchased as a child from Sears and Roebuck was a Teisco Del Rey.  He played the guitar in his elementary school band The Broken CombsVan Halen was an inveterate tinkerer and played many custombuilt and heavily modified guitars especially early in his career.  Upon embarking on his professional music career he purchased a Gibson Les Paul for which he replaced the original P90 pickup on the bridge with a humbucker in order to sound like Eric Clapton. He later bought and briefly used a Gibson ES335, also because of its association with Clapton though he damaged the body while modifying it and it later became cannibalized for parts on numerous other homebuild guitar projects.  He also owned an Ibanez Destroyer that was used extensively on the debut Van Halen album.  Originally used in its natural wood finish he later painted it white and made several modifications to the electronics.  After recording the album he used a chainsaw to drastically modify the body shape cutting a deep V into the bottom of the guitar and painting it in a similar way to his later more famous Frankenstrat.  Inset into the V he hand carved teeth and set two eyehooks and chains the new distinctive shape led to it being nicknamed The Shark.  He only played it for a short time in this state however as the modifications changed the tone of the guitar in an unsatisfactory way he did retain the guitar for the rest of his life remaining in his collection until his death.  The final state of the Shark can be seen on the cover of Women and Children First where he posed with the guitarHe is most associated with the Frankenstrat a custom guitar he built from parts. Originally pictured on Van Halens debut album Van Halen album the maple neck cost 80, while the ash body was bought for 50 as the wood had a knot in it. The tremolo arm was originally taken from a 1958 Fender Stratocaster and was later replaced with a Floyd Rose arm.  He frequently replaced the neck on the guitar going through a number of different ones through the years and the pickup configuration was also frequently changed.  In its most commonly used configuration the guitar had a single functional pickup a Gibson PAF bridge pickup from his ES335, which he enclosed with paraffin wax to prevent feedback.  The middle pickup was removed and in its place he had stuffed a nonfunctional selector switch and random wires while the neck pickup slot was replaced with a red singlecoil pickup that was also nonfunctional.  The original selector switches and tone knobs were removed and the volume knob was replaced with a knob labeled TONE.  The Frankenstrat as shown on the cover of Van Halen I was originally painted black but was recoated with Schwinn red bicycle paint in 1979Before and during the recording of Van Halen II he built a second partscaster guitar painted in a distinctive blackandyellow striped paint job that earned it the moniker The Bumblebee Guitar.  That guitar was later donated to Rita Haney the longtime partner of Dimebag Darrell Abbott shortly after his death it was placed in his casket and buried along with himEddie Van Halen used a miniLes Paul guitar for Little Guitars Diver Down. This is the only Van Halen recording that the guitar was used for. The miniLes Paul was made by Nashville luthier David Petschulat and was pitched and sold to him during a tour stop in Nashville Tennessee. He later purchased a second miniLP guitar built to slightly different specs the first being a honeysunburst with minihumbuckers and the second being dark winered with a thicker body and fullsize humbuckers. In 1982, Van Halen made his first guitar endorsement by launching the 5150 Baretta model with Kramer. This partnership lasted a decade.  In the mid 1980s he purchased a Steinberger GL2T guitar.  Its distinctive switchoperated vibrato system can be heard on the 5150 album.  From 1991 to 1995, Van Halen worked with Ernie Ball  Music Man developing the Music Man EVH model guitar which was later renamed the Axis after the partnership ended. In 1996, Van Halen teamed up with Peavey where they developed the Peavey EVH Wolfgang this relationship lasted until 2004, when Van Halen joined forces with Fender initially releasing the Edwardendorsed Art Series guitars under Fenders Charvel brand and later developing the EVH brand.  In 2006, Fender created the Frank 2\" a nearperfect production replica of the original Frankenstrat Van Halen later claimed that when presented the two guitars in a blind comparison he had some trouble picking out the original homemade guitar from Fenders production replicaFor Van Halens 2012 tour and early 2015 television appearances he used a Wolfgang USA guitar with a black finish and ebony fretboard. For the 2015 tour he used a white Wolfgang USA guitar designed by Chip Ellis featuring a custom kill switch.\n\nStrings\nVan Halens first string endorsement deal happened around 1989 when Ernie Ball launched the 5150 EVH line of guitar strings. The gauge of the strings differed slightly from typical electric guitar strings at the time which were 9, 11, 16, 24, 32 and 42 in thousandths of an inch  the EVH Ernie Ball strings measured 9, 11, 15, 24, 32 and 40. After this endorsement deal ended guitar strings became part of the Fender EVH line and are now sold as EVH Premium Strings.\n\nPickup selection\nVan Halen used a variety of pickups including 1970s Mighty Mites which were made by Seymour Duncan and were copies of DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. He also used Gibson PAFs one of which was rewound by Seymour Duncan in 1978In an interview with Guitar World in 1985, Van Halen stated that his guitar sound style which he called brown sound is ...basically a tone a feeling that Im always working at ... It comes from the person. If the person doesnt even know what that type of tone Im talking about is they cant really work towards it can they? In an interview with Billboard magazine in June 2015, he stated that with the expression brown sound he actually tried to describe the sound of his brother Alexs snare drum which he thought ...sounds like hes beating on a log. Its very organic. So it wasnt my brown sound. It was Alexs.\n\nKeyboards\nThe first recorded keyboard work by Van Halen is And the Cradle Will Rock.. written and performed on a Wurlitzer electric piano through a Marshall amp. The riff for Dancing in the Street on Diver Down was written and performed on Minimoog. Jump and Ill Wait were written and performed on an Oberheim OBXa while Dreams Why Cant This Be Love and Love Walks In are with Oberheim OB8. Eddie also wrote When Its Love and Right Now on keyboards.\nDuring the 5150 and OU812 tours Eddie Van Halen would play keyboard parts live while Hagar played the guitar. From the For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge tour Van Halen played guitar throughout the concerts while the keyboards were played backstage by touring keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald up through 2004, a fact kept lowkey in the press.\n\nAmplifiers\nIn 1993, Van Halen collaborated with Peavey Electronics to develop a series of amplifiers and cabinets collectively called the 5150 series which ended in 2004. Van Halen then began work with Fender developing the EVH products and brand.\n\nEVH brand\nIn 2007, the first EVH branded amplifiers were produced by Fender followed shortly after by a limitededition Frankenstrat inspired guitar.  In 2009, they continued to press forward on the guitar front by releasing the Wolfganginspired EVH guitar line. The brand has since expanded to include additional guitars and accessories.\n\nPatents\nVan Halen was awarded three patents related to guitars a folding prop to support a guitar in a flat position a tensionadjusting tailpiece and an ornamental design for a headstock.\n\nStyle and influence\nTapping\nVan Halens 1978 instrumental solo Eruption which was voted number 2 in Guitar Worlds readers poll of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos showcased the tapping technique which uses both left and right hands on the guitar neck. Although he popularized tapping he did not invent the technique. According to MusicRadar Steve Hackett  lead guitarist with Genesis in the 1970s  is widely credited with inventing twohanded tapping and was an influence on Van Halen. When asked about this Hackett said Eddie and I have never spoken about it but yes he has credited me with tapping.. Eddie is a fine player of course and hes the one who named the technique.\nGeorge Lynch said in an interview that he and Van Halen saw Harvey Mandel tap at the Starwood in the 1970s. Van Halen named Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin as an influence saying in one interview with Guitar WorldI think I got the idea of tapping watching Jimmy Page do his Heartbreaker solo back in 1971. He was doing a pulloff to an open string and I thought wait a minute open string ... pull off. I can do that but what if I use my finger as the nut and move it around? I just kind of took it and ran with it.\nUntil it expired in 2005, Van Halen held a patent for a flipout support device that attaches to the rear of the electric guitar. This device enables the user to employ the tapping technique by playing the guitar in a manner similar to the piano with the face of the guitar oriented upward instead of forward.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1980, Van Halen met actress Valerie Bertinelli at a Van Halen concert in Shreveport Louisiana. They married in California eight months later on April 11, 1981, and had one son Wolfgang in 1991. In 2005, Bertinelli filed for divorce in Los Angeles after four years of separation. The divorce was finalized in 2007The following year Eddie proposed to his girlfriend Janie Liszewski an actress and stuntwoman who was Van Halens publicist at the time. The two married in 2009 at his Studio City estate with his son Wolfgang and exwife Bertinelli in attendance. His brother Alex Van Halen is an ordained minister and he officiated Eddies 2009 wedding and that of his former sisterinlaw Valerie Bertinelli when she remarried in 2011.\n\nHealth issues and death\nVan Halen struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction throughout his life. He began smoking and drinking at the age of 12, and he stated that he eventually needed alcohol to function. He entered rehabilitation in 2007, and shared in a 2015 interview that he had been sober since 2008He was diagnosed with chronic avascular necrosis in 1995. After suffering from lingering injuries from past highrisk acrobatic stage performances and crashes Eddie underwent hip replacement surgery in 1999. He began receiving treatment for tongue cancer in 2000. The subsequent surgery removed roughly a third of his tongue. He was declared cancerfree in 2002. He blamed the tongue cancer on his habit of holding guitar picks in his mouth stating in 2015: I used metal picks  theyre brass and copper  which I always held in my mouth in the exact place where I got the tongue cancer. ... I mean I was smoking and doing a lot of drugs and a lot of everything. But at the same time my lungs are totally clear. This is just my own theory but the doctors say its possible.In 2012, Van Halen underwent emergency surgery for a severe bout of diverticulitis. Recovery time required due to the surgery led to postponement of Van Halen tour dates scheduled in Japan. Van Halen was later hospitalized in 2019 after battling throat cancer over the previous five years and his exwife Valerie Bertinelli also mentioned a battle with lung cancer in an Instagram post shortly after his death. He died of a stroke at Saint Johns Health Center in Santa Monica California on October 6, 2020, at the age of 65, surrounded by his wife Janie son and current at the time bassist of Van Halen Wolfgang exwife Valerie Bertinelli and brother and cofounderdrummer of Van Halen Alex. His son Wolfgang confirmed his death on social media later that same day. Some of Van Halens childhood landmarks in Pasadena became memorials where fans could pay their respects.\n\nLegacy\nIn February 2017, Van Halen donated 75 guitars from his personal collection to The Mr. Hollands Opus Foundation a program that provides musical instruments to students in lowincome schools. At the 2020 Billboard Music Awards Eddie Van Halen was honored by several former musicians he worked with. Jack White from The White Stripes G. E. Smith Charlie Benante from Anthrax and Dierks Bentley gave speeches as a tribute to his career. Wolfgang Van Halen also shared several personal photos between him and his father. On October 10, 2020, Saturday Night Live paid tribute by playing a clip of him performing with G. E. Smith from a February 1987 show which was hosted by Valerie Bertinelli. In 2020, the Pasadena Library located in Pasadena California offered several archives and documents related to Eddie Van Halen. The collection included several albums along with photographs by Neil Zlozower and several CDs. The library also uploaded Van Halens albums to Hoopla. On November 16, 2020, his son Wolfgang Van Halen announced on The Howard Stern Show that Van Halen would not continue as a band saying You cant have Van Halen without Eddie Van Halen.

He is regarded as one of the most successful and influential guitarists in rock music. He ranked second in Rolling Stones list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time and fourth in Gibsons Top 50 Guitarists of All Time. In 2023, Rolling Stone named Clapton the 35th best guitarist of all time. He was also named number five in Time magazines list of The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players in 2009After playing in a number of different local bands Clapton joined the Yardbirds from 1963 to 1965, and John Mayall  the Bluesbreakers from 1965 to 1966. After leaving Mayall he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassistvocalist Jack Bruce in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and arty bluesbased psychedelic pop. After four successful albums Cream broke up in November 1968. Clapton then formed the blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker Steve Winwood and Ric Grech recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up. Clapton then toured with Delaney  Bonnie and recorded his first solo album in 1970, before forming Derek and the Dominos with Bobby Whitlock Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. Like Blind Faith the band only lasted one album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs which includes Layla one of Claptons signature songs.\nClapton continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades including a 1974 cover of Bob Marleys I Shot the Sheriff which helped reggae reach a mass market the countryinfused Slowhand album 1977) and the pop rock of 1986's August.  Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Claptons grief was expressed in the song Tears in Heaven which appeared on his Unplugged album. In 1996 he had another top40 hit with the RB crossover Change the World. In 1998, he released the Grammy awardwinning My Fathers Eyes. Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is Happy Xmas 2018).\nClapton has received 18 Grammy Awards as well as the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2004, he was awarded a CBE for services to music. He has received four Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters Composers and Authors including the Lifetime Achievement Award. He is the only threetime inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream. In his solo career he has sold more than 280 million records worldwide making him one of the bestselling musicians of all time. In 1998, Clapton a recovering alcoholic and drug addict founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua a medical facility for those recovering from substance abuse.\n\nEarly life\nClapton was born on 30 March 1945 in Ripley Surrey England to 16-yearold Patricia Molly Clapton 1929\u20131999) and Edward Walter Fryer 1920\u20131985) a 25-yearold soldier from Montreal Quebec. Fryer was drafted to war before Claptons birth and then returned to Canada. Clapton grew up believing that his grandmother Rose and her second husband Jack Clapp Patricias stepfather were his parents and that his mother was actually his older sister. The similarity in surnames gave rise to the erroneous belief that Claptons real surname is Clapp Reginald Cecil Clapton was the name of Roses first husband Eric Claptons maternal grandfather. Years later his mother married another Canadian soldier and moved to Germany leaving Eric with his grandparents in SurreyClapton received an acoustic Hoyer guitar made in Germany for his thirteenth birthday but the inexpensive steelstringed instrument was difficult to play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later he picked it up again and started playing consistently. He was influenced by blues music from an early age and practised long hours learning the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reeltoreel tape recorder listening to them over and over until he was satisfiedIn 1961, after leaving Hollyfield School in Surbiton he studied at the Kingston College of Art but was expelled at the end of the academic year because his focus had remained on music rather than art. His guitar playing was sufficiently advanced that by the age of 16, he was getting noticed. Around this time he began busking around Kingston Richmond and the West End.\nIn 1962, he started performing as a duo with fellow blues enthusiast Dave Brock in pubs around Surrey. When he was 17, he joined his first band an early British RB group the Roosters whose other guitarist was Tom McGuinness. He stayed with them from January until August 1963. In October of that year he performed a sevengig stint with Casey Jones  the Engineers.\n\nCareer\nThe Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers\nIn October 1963, Clapton joined the Yardbirds a rhythm and blues band and stayed with them until March 1965. Synthesising influences from Chicago blues and leading blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy Freddie King and BB. King Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talkedabout guitarists in the British music scene. The band initially played ChessCheckerVeeJay blues numbers and began to attract a large cult following when they took over the Rolling Stones residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond London. They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II a joint LP album recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.\n\nYardbirds rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja recalled that whenever Clapton broke a guitar string during a concert he would stay on stage and replace it. The English audiences would wait out the delay by doing what is called a slow handclap. Claptons nickname of Slowhand came from Giorgio Gomelsky a pun on the slow handclapping that ensued when Clapton stopped playing while he replaced a string. In December 1964, Clapton made his first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Yardbirds. Since then Clapton has performed at the Hall over 200 times and has stated that performing at the venue is like playing in my front room.In March 1965, Clapton and the Yardbirds had their first major hit For Your Love written by songwriter Graham Gouldman who also wrote hit songs for Hermans Hermits and the Hollies and later achieved success of his own as a member of 10cc. In part because of its success the Yardbirds elected to move toward a poporientated sound much to the annoyance of Clapton who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that For Your Love went public a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member. Clapton suggested fellow guitarist Jimmy Page as his replacement but Page declined out of loyalty to Clapton putting Jeff Beck forward. Beck and Page played together in the Yardbirds for a while but Beck Page and Clapton were never in the group together. They first appeared together in 1983 on the 12-date benefit tour for Action for Research into multiple sclerosis with the first date on 23 September at the Royal Albert HallClapton joined John Mayall  the Bluesbreakers in April 1965, only to quit a few months later. In June Clapton was invited to jam with Jimmy Page recording a number of tracks that were retroactively credited to The Immediate AllStars. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. After a car crash that killed the bassist and injured the guitarist of the Greek band the Juniors on 17 October 1965 the surviving members played memorial shows in which Clapton played with the band. In October 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers Clapton briefly collaborated on a side project with Jack Bruce and Steve Winwood among others recording only a few tracks under the name Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. During his second Bluesbreakers stint Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained fame for playing on the influential album Blues Breakers  John Mayall  With Eric Clapton this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time in July 1966. The album itself is often called The Beano Album by fans because of its cover photograph showing Clapton reading the British childrens comic The BeanoHaving swapped his Fender Telecaster and Vox AC30 amplifier for a 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar and Marshall amplifier Claptons sound and playing inspired the famous slogan Clapton is God spraypainted by an unknown admirer on a wall in Islington North London in 1967. The graffito was captured in a nowfamous photograph in which a dog is urinating on the wall. Clapton is reported to have been embarrassed by the slogan saying in his The South Bank Show profile in 1987, I never accepted that I was the greatest guitar player in the world. I always wanted to be the greatest guitar player in the world but thats an ideal and I accept it as an ideal.\n\nCream\nClapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 replaced by Peter Green and was invited by drummer Ginger Baker to play in his newly formed band Cream one of the earliest supergroups with Jack Bruce on bass Bruce was previously of the Bluesbreakers the Graham Bond Organisation and Manfred Mann. Before the formation of Cream Clapton was not well known in the United States he left the Yardbirds before For Your Love hit the US top ten and had yet to perform there. During his time with Cream Clapton began to develop as a singer songwriter and guitarist though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist Pete Brown. Creams first gig was an unofficial performance at the Twisted Wheel Club in Manchester on 29 July 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor. Cream established its enduring legend with the highvolume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.\nBy early 1967, fans of the emerging bluesrock sound in the UK had begun to portray Clapton as Britains top guitarist however he found himself rivalled by the emergence of Jimi Hendrix an acid rockinfused guitarist who used wailing feedback and effects pedals to create new sounds for the instrument. Hendrix attended a performance of the newly formed Cream at the Central London Polytechnic on 1 October 1966, during which he sat in on a doubletimed version of Killing Floor. Top UK stars including Clapton Pete Townshend and members of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles avidly attended Hendrixs early club performances. Hendrixs arrival had an immediate and major effect on the next phase of Claptons career.\nClapton first visited the United States while touring with Cream. In March 1967, Cream performed a nineshow stand at the RKO Theater in New York. Claptons 1964 painted Gibson SG guitar  The Fool  a psychedelic fantasy according to Clapton made its debut at the RKO Theater. Clapton used the guitar for most of Creams recordings after Fresh Cream particularly on Disraeli Gears until the band broke up in 1968. One of the worlds bestknown guitars it symbolises the psychedelic era. They recorded Disraeli Gears in New York from 11 to 15 May 1967. Creams repertoire varied from hard rock I Feel Free to lengthy bluesbased instrumental jams Spoonful. Disraeli Gears contained Claptons searing guitar lines Bruces soaring vocals and prominent fluid bass playing and Bakers powerful polyrhythmic jazzinfluenced drumming. Together Creams talents secured them as an influential power trio. Claptons voice can be heard on Frank Zappas album Were Only in It for the Money on the tracks Are You Hung Up? and Nasal Retentive Calliope Music.\nIn 28 months Cream had become a commercial success selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalists role in rock and were one of the first bluesrock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazzstyle improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include Sunshine of Your Love No. 5, 1968) White Room No. 6, 1968) and Crossroads No. 28, 1969)  a live version of Robert Johnsons Cross Road Blues. Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights the supergroup was shortlived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Creams demise. A strongly critical Rolling Stone review of a concert of the groups second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trios demise and it affected Clapton profoundly. Clapton has also credited Music from Big Pink the debut album of The Band and its revolutionary Americana sound as influencing his decision to leave CreamCreams farewell album Goodbye comprising live performances recorded at The Forum Los Angeles on 19 October 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded. It also spawned the studio single Badge cowritten by Clapton and George Harrison Clapton had met and become close friends with Harrison after the Beatles shared a bill with the Claptonera Yardbirds at the London Palladium. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrisons While My Guitar Gently Weeps from the Beatles selftitled double album also known as the White Album. Harrisons debut solo album Wonderwall Music 1968) became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrisons albums due to contractual restraints and Harrison was credited as LAngelo Misterioso for his contributions to the song Badge on Goodbye. The pair often played live together as each others guest. A year after Harrisons death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the Concert for GeorgeIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became Let It Be tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days prompting John Lennon to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return. Michael LindsayHogg television director of the recording sessions for Let It Be later recalled I was there when John mentioned Clapton  but that wasnt going to happen. Would Eric have become a Beatle? No. Paul McCartney didnt want to go there. He didnt want them to break up. Then George came back. Clapton was on good terms with all four of the Beatles in December 1968 he had played with Lennon at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus as part of the oneoff group the Dirty MacCream briefly reunited in 1993 to perform at the ceremony inducting them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A full reunion took place in May 2005, with Clapton Bruce and Baker playing four soldout concerts at Londons Royal Albert Hall and three shows at New Yorks Madison Square Garden that October. Recordings from the London shows Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005, were released on CD LP and DVD in late 2005.\n\nBlind Faith\nClaptons next group Blind Faith formed in 1969, was composed of Cream drummer Ginger Baker Steve Winwood of Traffic and Ric Grech of Family and yielded one LP and one arenacircuit tour. The supergroup debuted before 100,000 fans in Londons Hyde Park on 7 June 1969. They performed several dates in Scandinavia and began a soldout American tour in July before their only album was released. The LP Blind Faith consisted of just six songs one of them the hit Cant Find My Way Home. Another Presence of the Lord is the first song credited solely to Clapton. The albums jacket image of a topless pubescent girl was deemed controversial in the US and was replaced by a photograph of the band. Blind Faith dissolved after less than seven months.\n\nDelaney  Bonnie and first solo album\nClapton subsequently toured as a sideman for an act that had opened for Blind Faith Delaney and Bonnie and Friends. He also performed as a member of Lennons Plastic Ono Band at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival in September 1969, a recording from which was released as the album Live Peace in Toronto 1969. On 30 September Clapton played lead guitar on Lennons second solo single Cold Turkey. On 15 December that year Clapton performed with Lennon Harrison and others as the Plastic Ono Supergroup at a fundraiser for UNICEF in LondonDelaney Bramlett encouraged Clapton in his singing and writing. Using the Bramletts backing group and an allstar cast of session players including Leon Russell and Stephen Stills Clapton recorded his first solo album during two brief tour hiatuses titled Eric Clapton. Delaney Bramlett cowrote six of the songs with Clapton also producing the LP and Bonnie Bramlett cowrote Let It Rain. The album yielded the unexpected US No. 18 hit J. J. Cales After Midnight. Clapton also worked with much of Delaney and Bonnies band to record George Harrisons All Things Must Pass in spring 1970.\nDuring this period Clapton also recorded with artists such as Dr. John Leon Russell Billy Preston Ringo Starr and Dave Mason. With Chicago blues artist Howlin Wolf he recorded The London Howlin Wolf Sessions that also included longtime Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin and members of the Rolling Stones Winwood and Starr. Despite the superstar lineup critic Cub Koda noted Even Eric Clapton who usually welcomes any chance to play with one of his idols has criticized this album repeatedly in interviews which speaks volumes in and of itself. Other noted recordings from this period include Claptons guitar work on Go Back Home from Stephen Stills selftitled first solo album.\n\nDerek and the Dominos\nWith the intention of counteracting the star cult faction that had begun to form around him Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnies former rhythm section Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist Carl Radle as the bassist and drummer Jim Gordon with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role and functioned well as a member of an ensemble. During this period Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their 1968 album Music from Big Pink saying What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three and fourpart harmonies and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity  or pseudovirtuosity  thing of long boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song.\nThe band was originally called Eric Clapton and Friends. The eventual name was a fluke that occurred when the bands provisional name of Del and the Dynamos was misread as Derek and the Dominos. Claptons biography states that Tony Ashton of Ashton Gardner and Dyke told Clapton to call the band Del and the Dominos since Del was his nickname for Eric Clapton. Del and Eric were combined and the final name became Derek and the Dominos.Claptons close friendship with George Harrison brought him into contact with Harrisons wife Pattie Boyd with whom he became deeply infatuated. When she spurned his advances Claptons unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs 1970). Heavily bluesinfluenced the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman with Allmans slide guitar as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at Criteria Studios in Miami with Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd who had worked with Clapton on Creams Disraeli Gears the band recorded a double album.\nThe album contained the hit love song Layla inspired by the classical poet of Persian literature Nizami Ganjavis The Story of Layla and Majnun a copy of which Ian Dallas had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her. The two parts of Layla were recorded in separate sessions the opening guitar section was recorded first and for the second section laid down a few weeks later drummer Jim Gordon played the piano part for the melody which he claimed to have written though Bobby Whitlock stated that Rita Coolidge wrote it.The Layla LP was actually recorded by a fivepiece version of the group thanks to the unforeseen inclusion of guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band. A few days into the Layla sessions Dowd  who was also producing the Allmans  invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage then played all night in the studio and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to Tell the Truth and Nobody Knows You When Youre Down and Out. In four days the fivepiece Dominos recorded Key to the Highway Have You Ever Loved a Woman a blues standard popularised by Freddie King and others and Why Does Love Got to be So Sad? In September Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band and the fourpiece Dominos recorded I Looked Away Bell Bottom Blues and Keep on Growing. Allman returned to record I Am Yours Anyday and Its Too Late. On 9 September they recorded Hendrixs Little Wing and the title track. The following day the final track Its Too Late was recorded.\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix eight days previously the band had cut a cover of Little Wing as a tribute. On 17 September 1970, one day before Hendrixs death Clapton had purchased a lefthanded Fender Stratocaster that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Claptons woes Layla received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Claptons later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol it resulted in the live double album In ConcertRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on 29 October 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the Layla sessions in Florida he talked about Allman as the musical brother Id never had but wished I did. Although Radle remained Claptons bass player until the summer of 1979 Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again Clapton guested on Whitlocks appearance on the Later with Jools Holland show. Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer Jim Gordon who had undiagnosed schizophrenia and years later murdered his mother during a psychotic episode. Gordon was confined to 16-yearstolife imprisonment later being moved to a mental institution where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nPersonal problems and early solo success\nClaptons career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast with the struggles he coped with in his personal life which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction. Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up. He nursed a heroin addiction which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrisons Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there he passed out on stage was revived and managed to finish his performance. In January 1973, the Whos Pete Townshend organised a comeback concert for Clapton at Londons Rainbow Theatre titled the Rainbow Concert to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton returned the favour by playing The Preacher in Ken Russells film version of the Whos Tommy in 1975. His appearance in the film performing Eyesight to the Blind is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set.\nIn 1974, Clapton started living with Boyd they would not marry until 1979) and was no longer using heroin although he gradually began to drink heavily. He assembled a lowkey touring band that included Radle Miami guitarist George Terry keyboardist Dick Sims who died in 2011) drummer Jamie Oldaker and vocalists Yvonne Elliman and Marcy Levy also known as Marcella Detroit. With this band Clapton recorded 461 Ocean Boulevard 1974) an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos the cover version of I Shot the Sheriff was Claptons first number one hit. The 1975 album Theres One in Every Crowd continued this trend. The albums original title The Worlds Greatest Guitar Player Theres One in Every Crowd was changed before pressing as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP E. C. Was Here. Clapton continued to release albums and toured regularly. Highlights of the period include No Reason to Cry a collaboration with Bob Dylan and The Band Slowhand which contained Wonderful Tonight and a second J. J. Cale cover Cocaine. In 1976, he performed as one of a string of notable guests at the farewell performance of The Band filmed in a Martin Scorsese documentary titled The Last Waltz.\n\nContinued success\nIn 1981, Clapton was invited by producer Martin Lewis to appear at the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policemans Other Ball in London. Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duets  reportedly their first ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show and one of the songs appeared in the film. The performances at Londons Drury Lane theatre heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade. Many factors had influenced Claptons comeback including his deepening commitment to Christianity to which he had converted prior to his heroin addictionAfter calling his manager and admitting he was an alcoholic Clapton flew to MinneapolisSaint Paul in January 1982 and checked in at Hazelden Treatment Center located in Center City Minnesota. On the flight over Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks for fear he would never be able to drink again. Clapton wrote in his autobiography\nIn the lowest moments of my life the only reason I didnt commit suicide was that I knew I wouldnt be able to drink any more if I was dead. It was the only thing I thought was worth living for and the idea that people were about to try and remove me from alcohol was so terrible that I drank and drank and drank and they had to practically carry me into the clinic.\nAfter being discharged it was recommended by doctors of Hazelden that Clapton not partake in any activities that would act as triggers for his alcoholism or stress. But it did happen. Clapton would go back to the Hazelden Treatment Center in November 1987. He has stayed sober ever since. A few months after his discharge from his first rehab Clapton began working on his next album against doctors orders. Working with Tom Dowd he produced what he thought as his most forced album to date Money and Cigarettes. Clapton chose the name of the album because thats all I saw myself having left after his first rehabilitation from alcoholismIn 1984, he performed on former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters solo album The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and participated in the supporting tour. Since then Waters and Clapton have had a close relationship. In 2005, they performed together for the Tsunami Relief Fund. In 2006, they performed at the Highclere Castle in aid of the Countryside Alliance playing two set pieces of Wish You Were Here and Comfortably Numb. Clapton now a regular charity performer played at the Live Aid concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia on 13 July 1985, playing with Phil Collins Tim Renwick Chris Stainton Jamie Oldaker Marcy Levy Shaun Murphy and Donald Duck Dunn. When offered a slot close to peak viewing hours he was apparently flattered. His album output continued in the 1980s including two produced with Phil Collins 1985's Behind the Sun which produced the hits Forever Man and Shes Waiting and 1986's AugustAugust was suffused with Collinss trademark drum and horn sound and became Claptons biggest seller in the UK to date matching his highest chart position number 3. The albums first track the hit Its in the Way That You Use It appeared in the Tom CruisePaul Newman film The Color of Money. The songs Tearing Us Apart with Tina Turner and Miss You continued Claptons more angry sound. This rebound kicked off Claptons twoyear period of touring with Collins and their August collaborators bassist Nathan East and keyboard playersongwriter Greg Phillinganes. While on tour for August two concert videos were recorded of the fourman band Eric Clapton Live from Montreux and Eric Clapton and Friends. Clapton later remade After Midnight as a single and a promotional track for the Michelob beer brand which had also used earlier songs by Collins and Steve Winwood. Clapton won a British Academy Television Award for his collaboration with Michael Kamen on the score for the 1985 BBC television thriller series Edge of Darkness. At the 1987 Brit Awards in London Clapton was awarded the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 1987, he played on George Harrisons album Cloud Nine contributing guitar to Cloud 9\" Thats What It Takes Devils Radio and Wreck of the Hesperus.Clapton also got together with the Bee Gees for charity.

The Bunburys recorded three songs for The Bunbury Tails Were the Bunburys Bunbury Afternoon and Fight No Matter How Long. The last song also appeared on The 1988 Summer Olympics Album and went to No. 8 on the rock music chart.

He learned that Claptons father was Edward Walter Fryer born 21 March 1920, in Montreal and died 15 May 1985 in Newmarket Ontario.

On 21 June 2014, Clapton abruptly walked off stage during a concert at the Glasgow Hydro. Although he did return to perform one final song thousands of fans were upset by the lack of explanation from Clapton or the venue and booed after the concert ended around 40 minutes before advertised to finish. Both Clapton and the venue apologised the next day blaming technical difficulties for making sound conditions unbearable for Clapton on stage. A week later he confirmed his retirement plans attributing his decision to the road being unbearable in addition to odd ailments that may force him to put down his guitar permanently. In a 2016 interview with Classic Rock magazine Clapton revealed that he had been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in 2013, a condition involving damage to peripheral nerves that typically causes stabbing burning or tingling pain in the arms and legs.\nClapton performed two shows at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 and 3 May 2015 followed by a 7-night residency at Londons Royal Albert Hall from 14 to 23 May 2015 to celebrate his 70th birthday on 30 March.

King Albert King Buddy Guy and Hubert Sumlin as guitarplaying influences. In his 2007 autobiography Clapton refers to Muddy Waters as the father figure I never really had. Until his death in 1983, Waters was a part of Claptons life. When I got to know Muddy unfortunately my drinking career was in full sway. In 2000, Clapton collaborated with BB. King on their album Riding with the King. The music video for the title track shows Clapton as the chauffeur with one of his idols in the back seatClapton has said that blues musician Robert Johnson is his single most important influence. In 2004, Clapton released Sessions for Robert Johnson containing covers of Johnsons songs using electric and acoustic guitars. In an essay for the 1990 boxed set of Johnsons recordings Clapton wrote\n\nRobert Johnson to me is the most important blues musician who ever lived. He was true absolutely to his own vision and as deep as I have gotten into the music over the last 30 years I have never found anything more deeply soulful than Robert Johnson. His music remains the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice really ... it seemed to echo something I had always felt. italics in original\nClapton also singled out Buddy Holly as an influence. The Chirping Crickets was the first album Clapton ever bought he later saw Holly on Sunday Night at the London Palladium. In his autobiography Clapton recounts the first time he saw Holly and his Fender saying I thought Id died and gone to heaven ... it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself Thats the future  thats what I want. In the 2017 documentary film Eric Clapton Life in 12 Bars Clapton cites Bismillah Khan as an influence adding that I wanted my guitar to sound like his reed instrument. In the same documentary he also cited harmonica player Little Walter as an influence The sound he made with the harmonica playing through an amplifier. It was thick and fat and very melodic.\n\nLegacy\nClapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton is the only threetime inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. He ranked second in Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time and fourth in Gibsons Top 50 Guitarists of All TimeIn 2011, The Guardian attributed the creation of the cult of the guitar hero to Clapton ranking it number seven on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history\n\nNothing is more central to rock mythology than the cult of the lead guitarist. And no one did more to create that cult than Eric Clapton. He had already been a member of the Yardbirds before joining John Mayalls Bluesbreakers the clearing house for guitarists in April 1965. His two stints with Mayall saw his reputation grow to the extent that a famous graffito captured the popular appraisal of him among rock fans Clapton is God.\nElias Leight of Rolling Stone writes that Clapton influenced recording techniques as well as guitarplaying technique. During recording sessions with John Mayalls group Clapton was frustrated by technicians that just came up to your amp with the microphone and just stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier. It seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere we were getting in the clubs you needed it to sound like you were in the audience 10 feet away not three inches. Clapton then moved the microphones with Pink Floyds Roger Waters stating That changed everything. Before Eric guitar playing in England had been Hank Marvin of the Shadows very simple not much technique. Suddenly we heard something completely different. The records sounded unlike anything we had heard before.In 2012, Clapton was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his artwork  the Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover  to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday. Indelibly linked to the Royal Albert Hall in London a venue he has played at more than any other in his 50-year plus career Clapton was inducted into the Royal Albert Halls Walk of Fame in 2018, making him one of the first eleven recipients of a star on the walk thus joining Muhammad Ali Winston Churchill the Suffragettes and Albert Einstein among others who were viewed as key players in the buildings historyRobert Christgau in a dissenting appraisal of Claptons legacy writes\n\nA promiscuous sideman whose monklike aura has never diminished his extravagant appetites Clapton likes to get paid and hes amassed a discography that for an artist of his caliber is remarkably undistinguished. In his selfprotective selfdeprecation he often attributes this to his own laziness or his need for a catalyst but its also guitar heros disease like many other guys whose handear coordination is off the curve hes a casual tunesmith and a corny lyricist and his band concepts are chronically hitormiss.\n\nGuitars\nLike Hank Marvin the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix Clapton exerted a crucial and widespread influence in popularising particular models of electric guitar. With the Yardbirds Clapton played a Fender Telecaster a Fender Jazzmaster a doublecutaway Gretsch 6120, and a 1964 CherryRed Gibson ES335. He became exclusively a Gibson player for a period beginning in mid1965, when he purchased a used sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar from a guitar store in London. Clapton commented on the slim profile of the neck which would indicate it was a 1960 modelEarly during his stint in Cream Claptons first Les Paul Standard was stolen. He continued to play Les Pauls exclusively with Cream one bought from Andy Summers was almost identical to the stolen guitar until 1967, when he acquired his most famous guitar in this period a 1964 Gibson SG dubbed the Fool. Clapton used both the Les Paul and the SG to create his selfdescribed woman tone. He explained in a 1967 interview I am playing more smoothly now. Im developing what I call my woman tone. Its a sweet sound something like the solo on I Feel Free. Writer Michael Dregni describes it as thick yet piercing overdriven yet smooth distorted yet creamy. The tone is achieved by a combination of tone control settings on the guitars and Claptons Marshall JTM45 amplifierVintage Guitar magazine identifies the opening riff and solo of Sunshine of Your Love are arguably the best illustrations of fullblown woman tone. Claptons Fool acquired its name from its distinctive psychedelic paint job created by the visual art collective also known as the Fool just before Creams first US appearance in 1967, Claptons SG Bruces Fender VI and Bakers drum head were all repainted in psychedelic designs.\n\nIn 1968, Clapton bought a Gibson Firebird and started using the 1964 CherryRed Gibson ES335 again. The aforementioned 1964 ES335 had a storied career. Clapton used it at the last Cream show in November 1968 as well as with Blind Faith played it sparingly for slide pieces in the 1970s used it on Hard Times from Journeyman the Hyde Park live concert of 1996, and the From the Cradle sessions and tour of 1994\u201395. It was sold for US847,500 at a 2004 auction. Gibson produced a limited run of 250 Crossroads 335\" replicas. The 335 was only the second electric guitar Clapton boughtIn July 1968 Clapton gave George Harrison a 1957 goldtop Gibson Les Paul that been refinished with a red colour nicknamed Lucy. The following September Clapton played the guitar on the Beatles recording of While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Lucy was stolen from Harrison though later tracked down and returned to him  he lent it to Clapton for his 1973 comeback concert at the Rainbow. His SG The Fool found its way into the hands of George Harrisons friend Jackie Lomax who subsequently sold it to musician Todd Rundgren for US500 in 1972. Rundgren restored the guitar and nicknamed it Sunny after Sunshine of Your Love. He retained it until 2000, when he sold it at an auction for US150,000. At the 1969 Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park London Clapton played a Fender Custom Telecaster which was fitted with Brownies neck.\n\nIn late 1969 Clapton made the switch to the Fender Stratocaster. I had a lot of influences when I took up the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one but that wasnt really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility and when he started playing one I thought oh if he can do it I can do it. The firstused during the recording of Eric Claptonwas Brownie which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Claptons guitars Blackie. In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Shobud guitar shop in Nashville Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison Steve Winwood and Pete Townshend. His very first Stratocaster Brownie was purchased on May 7, 1967  and made its debut in 1970 on his first solo album in concert with Derek and the Dominos as well on the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. \nClapton assembled the best components of the remaining three to create Blackie which was his favourite stage guitar until its retirement in 1985. It was first played live 13 January 1973 at the Rainbow Concert. Clapton called the 1956/57 Strat a mongrel. On 24 June 2004, Clapton sold Blackie at Christies Auction House New York for US959,500 to raise funds for his Crossroads Centre for drug and alcohol addictions. Brownie is now on display at the Experience Music Project. The Fender Custom Shop has since produced a limited run of 275 Blackie replicas correct in every detail right down to the Duck Brothers flight case and artificially aged using Fenders Relic process to simulate years of hard wear. One was presented to Clapton upon the models release and was used for three numbers during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 17 May 2006. In 1979, Clapton gave his signed Fender Lead II guitar to the Hard Rock Cafe in London to designate his favourite bar stool. Pete Townshend also donated his own Gibson Les Paul guitar with a note attached Mines as good as his! Love Pete.Signature guitars in Claptons honour are made by Fender and CF. Martin  Company. In 1988, Fender introduced his signature Eric Clapton Stratocaster. Several signaturemodel 000-sized acoustic guitars made by Martin. The first of these introduced in 1995, was a limited edition 000-42EC Eric Clapton signature model with a production run of 461. For the single Change the World 1996) and the album Pilgrim 1998) he used a Martin 000-28 EC Eric Clapton signature model which he subsequently gave to guitarist Paul Wassif. His 1939 000-42 Martin that he played on the Unplugged album sold for US791,500 at auction. Clapton uses Ernie Ball Slinky and Super Slinky strings gauge .10 to46. His guitar technician for over thirty years was Lee Dickson.\n\nOther media appearances\nClapton appeared in the movie version of Tommy the first fulllength rock opera written by the Who.

Clapton wrote the film score for Zanucks 1991 film Rush and the two remained friends. In an interview for BBC News Zanuck said that Clapton only agreed to participate if she directed it\n\nI think this got made because Eric was in the right mood. Hes an incredibly private man and despite his immense success hes never cared if he got any publicity at all he just loves his music ... I think it might be something to do with his age as he turned 70 a couple of years ago. He said to me I didnt want it to be done after I was dead and for it to be wrong. Maybe he thought his time had come to lay it all out on the table.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships\nClaptons partner from the late 1960s to 1974 was Alice OrmsbyGore a British aristocrat. They were together for three years and were both addicted to heroin. He briefly dated funk singer Betty DavisClapton became friends with George Harrison in the late 1960s and they began writing and recording music together. Clapton fell in love with Pattie Boyd who was married to Harrison at this time. Harrison and Boyd divorced in 1977 and she married Clapton on 27 March 1979, in Tucson Arizona. Their marriage was marred by his infidelities and domestic violence. During a 1999 interview with The Sunday Times Clapton admitted to raping and abusing her while they were married and he was a fullblown alcoholic who felt entitled to sex. In 1984, while recording Behind the Sun Clapton began a relationship with Yvonne Kelly the manager of AIR Studios Montserrat.

Visibly intoxicated on stage Clapton voiced his support for the rightwing British politician Enoch Powell. He addressed the audience as follows\n\n Do we have any foreigners in the audience tonight? If so please put up your hands. So where are you? Well wherever you all are I think you should all just leave. Not just leave the hall leave our country. I dont want you here in the room or in my country. Listen to me man! I think we should vote for Enoch Powell. Enochs our man. I think Enochs right I think we should send them all back. Stop Britain from becoming a black colony. Get the foreigners out. Get the wogs out. Get the coons out. Keep Britain white. I used to be into dope now Im into racism. Its much heavier man. Fucking wogs man. Fucking Saudis taking over London. Bastard wogs. Britain is becoming overcrowded and Enoch will stop it and send them all back. The black wogs and coons and Arabs and fucking Jamaicans dont belong here we dont want them here. This is England this is a white country we dont want any black wogs and coons living here. We need to make clear to them they are not welcome. England is for white people man. This is Great Britain a white country what is happening to us for fucks sake? Throw the wogs out! Keep Britain white!\nKeep Britain White was at the time a slogan of the farright National Front NF. This incident along with some controversial remarks made around the same time by David Bowie were the main catalysts for the creation of Rock Against Racism with a concert on 30 April 1978.\n\nClaptons response\nIn an interview from October 1976 with Sounds magazine Clapton said that he did not know much about politics and said of his immigration speech that I just dont know what came over me that night. It must have been something that happened in the day but it came out in this garbled thing. In a 2004 interview with Uncut Clapton referred to Enoch Powell as outrageously brave. He said that the UK was inviting people in as cheap labour and then putting them in ghettos. In 2004, Clapton told an interviewer for Scotland on Sunday Theres no way I could be a racist. It would make no sense. In his 2007 autobiography Clapton said he was deliberately oblivious to racial conflict. In a December 2007 interview with Melvyn Bragg on The South Bank Show Clapton said he was not a racist but still believed Powells comments were relevantAfter watching unedited footage of the 1976 outburst which is included in Eric Clapton Life in 12 Barsa documentary which also covers his daily alcohol and drug abuse prior to his sobrietyin 2018 Clapton stated he was disgusted with himself for his chauvinistic and fascistic comments on stage. He added I sabotaged everything I got involved with. I was so ashamed of who I was a kind of semiracist which didnt make sense. Half of my friends were black I dated a black woman and I championed black music.\n\nOpposition to foxhunting ban\nClapton supports the Countryside Alliance which promotes field sports and issues relating to the British countryside.

Morrisons stance was criticised by Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann. In July 2021, Clapton wrote that he would not perform on any stage where there is a discriminated audience present in response to Boris Johnson mandating that concert attendees be vaccinated. Clapton had by then taken both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and said he had had severe reactions to both injections. Whether the symptoms he reported were actually vaccinerelated was called into question by an NBC News editorial given that Clapton previously reported suffering the same symptoms as early as 2013 due to nerve damageIn August 2021, Clapton released the single This Has Gotta Stop and an accompanying music video. It was described as a protest song against COVID19 lockdowns vaccinations and contains  lyrical and visual statements against what Clapton sees as the erosion of civil liberties as the result of lockdown policiesClapton tested positive for COVID19 in May 2022 causing him to cancel some concerts in his tour schedule.\n\nIsraelPalestine conflict\nIn November 2023, during the IsraelHamas war Clapton released a song titled Voice of a Child along with a video featuring images of destruction in the Gaza Strip.

Beale Street was where it all started for me King said. He performed with Bobby Bland Johnny Ace and Earl Forest in a group known as the Beale StreetersAccording to King and Joe Bihari Ike Turner introduced King to the Bihari brothers while he was a talent scout at Modern Records. In 1949, King began recording songs under contract with Los Angelesbased RPM Records a subsidiary of Modern. Many of Kings early recordings were produced by Sam Phillips who later founded Sun Records. Before his RPM contract King had debuted on Bullet Records by issuing the single Miss Martha King 1949) which did not chart well. My very first recordings in 1949] weresic for a company out of Nashville called Bullet the Bullet Record Transcription company King recalled. I had horns that very first session. I had Phineas Newborn on piano his father played drums and his brother Calvin played guitar with me. I had Tuff Green on bass Ben Branch on tenor sax his brother Thomas on trumpet and a lady trombone player. The Newborn family were the house band at the famous Plantation Inn in West Memphis.King assembled his band the BB. King Review under the leadership of Millard Lee. The band initially consisted of Calvin Owens and Kenneth Sands trumpet Lawrence Burdin alto saxophone George Coleman tenor saxophone Floyd Newman baritone saxophone Millard Lee piano George Joyner bass and Earl Forest and Ted Curry drums.

He successfully worked both sides of the commercial divide with sophisticated recordings and raw raucous live performances.\n\n2006\u20132014\nIn 2006, King went on a farewell world tour although he remained active afterward. The tour was partly supported by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore with whom King had previously toured and recorded.

King did not reschedule the shows and the House of Blues show would be the last before his death in 2015.\n\nEquipment\nKing used equipment characteristic of the different periods he played in. He played guitars made by various manufacturers early in his career. He played a Fender Esquire on most of his recordings with RPM Records. Later he was best known for playing variants of the Gibson ES355.\nIn the September edition 1995 of Vintage Guitar magazine early photos show him playing a Gibson ES5 through a Fender tweed amp. In reference to the photo King stated\nYes the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable guys would throw them in the truck and theyd hold up. They had tubes and theyd get real hot but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great but I have an old Lab Series amp that isnt being made anymore. I fell in love with it because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin. Its what Im using tonight.\nHe later moved on from the larger Gibson hollowbodied instruments which were prone to feedback when played at high volumes to various semihollow models beginning first with the ES335 and then a deluxe version called the ES355, which employed a stereo option. In 1980, Gibson Guitar Corporation launched the BB. King Lucille model an ES355 with stereo options a varitone selector and fine tuners neither of which were actually used by King and at Kings direct request no fholes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles referred to as the 80th Birthday Lucille the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King and which he used thereafterKing used a Lab Series L5 2\u00d712\" combo amplifier and used this amplifier for a long time.

Kings Blues Club and in 1994, a second club was launched at Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles. A third club in New York Citys Times Square opened in June 2000 but closed on April 29, 2018. Management is currently in the process of finding a new location in New York City. Two more clubs opened at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut in January 2002, and in Nashville in 2003.

The failure of both marriages has been attributed to the heavy demands made by Kings 250 performances a year. It is reported that he fathered 15 children with several women. After his death three more have come forward claiming King as their father as well. Though neither of his marriages produced children and biographer Charles Sawyer wrote that doctors found his sperm count too low to conceive children King never disputed paternity of any of the 15 who claimed it and by all accounts was generous in bankrolling college tuitions and establishing trust funds. In May 2016, the 11 surviving children initiated legal proceedings against Kings appointed trustee over his estimated 30 million to 40 million estate. Several of them also went public with the allegation that Kings business manager LaVerne Toney and his personal assistant Myron Johnson had fatally poisoned him. Autopsy results showed no evidence of poisoning. A defamation suit filed by Johnson against the accusing family members including his own sister Karen Williams is pending. Other children have filed lawsuits targeting Kings music estate which remains in disputeKing was an FAAcertified private pilot and learned to fly in 1963 at what was then Chicago Hammond Airport in Lansing Illinois. He frequently flew to gigs but in 1995 his insurance company and manager asked him to fly only with another certified pilot. As a result he stopped flying around the age of 70Kings favorite singer was Frank Sinatra. In his autobiography he spoke about how he was a Sinatra nut and how he went to bed every night listening to Sinatras classic album In the Wee Small Hours. During the 1960s Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in whitedominated venues.\n\nPhilanthropy and notable campaigns\nIn September 1970, King recorded Live in Cook County Jail during a time in which issues of racism  and class in the prison system were prominent in politics. King also cofounded the Foundation for the Advancement of Inmate Rehabilitation and Recreation tying in his support for prisoners and interest in prison reform. In addition to prison reform King also wanted to use prison performances as a way to preserve music and songs in a similar way that Alan Lomax didIn 2002, King signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underprivileged public schools throughout the United States. He sat on the organizations honorary board of directorsDiagnosed with diabetes in 1990, King was a highprofile spokesman in the fight against the disease. He appeared in several television commercials for OneTouch Ultra a blood glucose monitoring device beginning in the early 2000s. American Idol contestant Crystal Bowersox who was diagnosed with diabetes at age six would costar with King in later commercials.\n\nDeath and funeral\nThe last eight shows of Kings 2014 tour were canceled because of health problems caused by complications from high blood pressure and diabetes. On May 14, 2015, at the age of 89, he died in his sleep from vascular dementia caused by a series of small strokes as a consequence of his type 2 diabetes. Two of his daughters alleged that King was deliberately poisoned by two associates trying to induce diabetic shock an autopsy showed no evidence of suchKings body was flown to Memphis on May 27, 2015. A funeral procession went down Beale Street with a brass band marching in front of the hearse while playing When the Saints Go Marching In. Thousands lined the streets to pay their last respects. His body was then driven down Route 61 to his hometown of Indianola Mississippi. He was laid in repose at the BB.

King episode from In Black America series distributed by the American Archive of Public Broadcasting", "James Patrick Page  born 9 January 1944) is an English musician and producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin. Prolific in creating guitar riffs Pages style involves various alternative guitar tunings and melodic solos coupled with aggressive distorted guitar tones. It is also characterized by his folk and easterninfluenced acoustic work. He is notable for occasionally playing his guitar with a cello bow to create a droning sound texture to the musicPage began his career as a studio session musician in London and by the mid1960s alongside Big Jim Sullivan was one of the most soughtafter session guitarists in Britain. He was a member of the Yardbirds from 1966 to 1968. When the Yardbirds broke up he founded Led Zeppelin which was active from 1968 to 1980. Following the death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham he participated in a number of musical groups throughout the 1980s and 1990s more specifically XYZ the Firm the Honeydrippers CoverdalePage and Page and Plant. Since 2000, Page has participated in various guest performances with many artists both live and in studio recordings and participated in a oneoff Led Zeppelin reunion in 2007 that was released as the 2012 concert film Celebration Day.  Along with the Edge and Jack White he participated in the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud.\nPage is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone magazine has described Page as the pontiff of power riffing and ranked him number three in their 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time behind Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton and ranking 3rd again in 2023 behind Chuck Berry and Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he was ranked number two in Gibsons list of Top 50 Guitarists of All Time and in 2007, number four on Classic Rocks 100 Wildest Guitar Heroes. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice once as a member of the Yardbirds 1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin 1995).\n\nEarly life\nPage was born to James Patrick Page and Patricia Elizabeth Gaffikin in the west London suburb of Heston on 9 January 1944. His father was a personnel manager at a plasticcoatings plant and his mother who was of Irish descent was a doctors secretary. In 1952, they moved to Feltham and then to Miles Road Epsom in Surrey. Page was educated from the age of eight at Epsom County Pound Lane Primary School and when he was eleven he went to Ewell County Secondary School in West Ewell. He came across his first guitar a Spanish guitar in the Miles Road house I dont know whether the guitar was left behind by the people in the house before us or whether it was a friend of the familysnobody seemed to know why it was there. First playing the instrument when aged 12, he took a few lessons in nearby Kingston but was largely selftaught\n\nWhen I grew up there werent many other guitarists ... There was one other guitarist in my school who actually showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously it was a very personal thing.\nThis other guitarist was a boy called Rod Wyatt a few years his senior and together with another boy Pete Calvert they would practise at Pages house Page would devote six or seven hours on some days to practising and would always take his guitar with him to secondary school only to have it confiscated and returned to him after class. \nAmong Pages early influences were rockabilly guitarists Scotty Moore and James Burton who both played on recordings made by Elvis Presley. Presleys song Baby Lets Play House is cited by Page as being his inspiration to take up the guitar and he would reprise Moores playing on the song in the live version of Whole Lotta Love on The Song Remains the Same. He appeared on BBC1 in 1957 with a H\u00f6fner President acoustic which hed bought from money saved up from his milk round in the summer holidays and which had a pickup so it could be amplified but his first solidbodied electric guitar was a secondhand 1959 Futurama Grazioso later replaced by a Fender Telecaster a model he had seen Buddy Holly playing on the TV and a reallife example of which hed played at an electronics exhibition at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in LondonPages musical tastes included skiffle a popular English music genre of the time and acoustic folk playing and the blues sounds of Elmore James BB. King Otis Rush Buddy Guy Freddie King and Hubert Sumlin. Basically that was the start a mixture between rock and blues.At the age of 13, Page appeared on Huw Wheldons All Your Own talent quest programme in a skiffle quartet one performance of which aired on BBC1 in 1957. The group played Mama Dont Want to Skiffle Anymore and another Americanflavoured song In Them Ol Cottonfields Back Home. When asked by Wheldon what he wanted to do after schooling Page said I want to do biological research to find a cure for cancer if it isnt discovered by then.In an interview with Guitar Player magazine Page stated that there was a lot of busking in the early days but as they say I had to come to grips with it and it was a good schooling. When he was fourteen and billed as James Page he played in a group called Malcolm Austin and Whirlwinds alongside Tony Busson on bass Stuart Cockett on rhythm and a drummer named Tom playing Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis numbers. This band was shortlived as Page soon found a drummer for a band hed previously been playing in with Rod Wyatt David Williams and Pete Calvert and came up with a name for them The Paramounts. The Paramounts played gigs in Epsom once supporting a group who would later become Johnny Kidd  the PiratesAlthough interviewed for a job as a laboratory assistant he ultimately chose to leave secondary school in West Ewell to pursue music doing so at the age of fifteen  the earliest age permitted at the time  having gained four GCE O levels and on the back of a major row with the school Deputy Head Miss Nicholson about his musical ambitions about which she was wholly scathingPage had difficulty finding other musicians with whom he could play on a regular basis. It wasnt as though there was an abundance. I used to play in many groups ... anyone who could get a gig together really. Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet Royston Ellis at the Mermaid Theatre between 1960 and 1961, and singer Red E. Lewis whod seen him playing with the Paramounts at the Contemporary club in Epsom and told his manager Chris Tidmarsh to ask Page to join his backing band the Redcaps after the departure of guitarist Bobby Oats Page was asked by singer Neil Christian to join his band the Crusaders. Christian had seen a fifteenyearold Page playing in a local hall and the guitarist toured with Christian for approximately two years and later played on several of his records including the 1962 single The Road to Love.During his stint with Christian Page fell seriously ill with glandular fever and could not continue touring. While recovering he decided to put his musical career on hold and concentrate on his other love painting and enrolled at Sutton Art College in Surrey. As he explained in 1975:\n\nI was travelling around all the time in a bus. I did that for two years after I left school to the point where I was starting to get really good bread. But I was getting ill. So I went back to art college. And that was a total change in direction. Thats why I say its possible to do. As dedicated as I was to playing the guitar I knew doing it that way was doing me in forever. Every two months I had glandular fever. So for the next 18 months I was living on ten dollars a week and getting my strength up. But I was still playing.\n\nCareer\nEarly 1960s session musician\nWhile still a student Page often performed on stage at the Marquee Club with bands such as Cyril Davies All Stars Alexis Korners Blues Incorporated and fellow guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard  the Silhouettes who asked him to help record some singles for Columbia Graphophone Company including The Worrying Kind. Mike Leander of Decca Records first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording Diamonds by Jet Harris and Tony Meehan which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963After brief stints with CarterLewis and the Southerners Mike Hurst and the Method and Mickey Finn and the Blue Men Page committed himself to fulltime session work. As a session guitarist he was known as Lil Jim Pea to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. Page was mainly called into sessions as insurance in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. It was usually myself and a drummer he explained though they never mention the drummer these days just me ... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim Sullivan or myself. He stated that In the initial stages they just said play what you want cos at that time I couldnt read music or anything.\n\nPage was the favoured session guitarist of record producer Shel Talmy. As a result he secured session work on songs for the Who and the Kinks. Page is credited with playing acoustic twelvestring guitar on two tracks on the Kinks debut album Im a Lover Not a Fighter and Ive Been Driving on Bald Mountain and possibly on the Bside I Gotta Move. He played rhythm guitar on the sessions for the Whos first single I Cant Explain although Pete Townshend was reluctant to allow Pages contribution on the final recording Page also played lead guitar on the Bside Bald Headed Woman. Pages studio gigs in 1964 and 1965 included Marianne Faithfulls As Tears Go By Jonathan Kings Everyones Gone to the Moon  the Nashville Teens Tobacco Road the Rolling Stones Heart of Stone along with Were Wasting Time also Van Morrison  Thems Baby Please Dont Go Mystic Eyes and Here Comes the Night Dave Berrys The Crying Game and My Baby Left Me Brenda Lees Is It True Shirley Basseys Goldfinger and  Petula Clarks Downtown.\nIn 1964, Page contributed guitar to the incidental music of the Beatles 1964 film A Hard Days NightIn 1965, Page was hired by Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham to act as house producer and AR man for the newly formed Immediate Records label which allowed him to play on andor produce tracks by John Mayall Nico Chris Farlowe Twice as Much and Clapton. Also in 1965, Page produced one of Dana Gillespies early singles Thank You Boy. Page also formed a brief songwriting partnership with then romantic interest Jackie DeShannon. He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams not to be confused with the film composer John Williams album The Maureeny Wishful Album with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on Donovan Leitchs Sunshine Superman on Engelbert Humperdincks Release Me the Johnny Hallyday albums Jeune homme and Je suis n\u00e9 dans la rue the Al Stewart album Love Chronicles and played guitar on five tracks of Joe Cockers debut album With a Little Help from My Friends. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 Roy Harper tracks comprising 81 minutes of music.\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that I was doing three sessions a day fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group sometimes I could be doing film music it could be a folk session ... I was able to fit all these different roles.Although Page recorded with many notable musicians many of these early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. Examples include early jam sessions featuring him and guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton covering various blues themes which were included on compilations released by Immediate Records. Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release Jimmy Page Session Man. He also recorded with Keith Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums a track called Scarlet was cut the same year he played acoustic guitar on The Stones Through the Lonely Nights. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech Keith and me doing a number called Scarlet. I cant remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Richards told people that it was a track from my album.Page left studio work when the increasing influence of Stax Records on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars. He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling\n\nMy session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions  and believe me I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do Muzak. I decided I couldnt live that life any more it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul SamwellSmith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place. But being a session musician was good fun in the beginning  the studio discipline was great. Theyd just count the song off and you couldnt make any mistakes.\n\nLate 1960s The Yardbirds\nIn late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds but he declined out of loyalty to his friend. In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions he suggested his friend Jeff Beck. On 16 May 1966, drummer Keith Moon bass player John Paul Jones keyboardist Nicky Hopkins Jeff Beck and Page recorded Becks Bolero in Londons IBC Studios. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new supergroup featuring Beck along with The Whos John Entwistle on bass and Moon on drums. However the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time Moon suggested the name Lead Zeppelin for the first time after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\nWithin weeks Page attended a Yardbirds concert at Oxford. After the show he went backstage where Paul SamwellSmith announced that he was leaving the group. Page offered to replace SamwellSmith and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when Chris Dreja moved to bass. The musical potential of the lineup was scuttled however by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success although they released one single Happenings Ten Years Time Ago. While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds the trio of Page Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the ARMS Charity Concerts in 1983.\nAfter Becks departure the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar Little Games. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success peaking at number 80 on the Billboard 200. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time the bands live performances were just the opposite becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin most notably performances of Dazed and Confused.\nAfter the departure of Keith Relf and Jim McCarty in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new lineup to fulfill unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end Page recruited vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham and he was also contacted by John Paul Jones who asked to join. During the Scandinavian tour the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle. Page stuck with that name to use for his new band. Manager Peter Grant changed it to Led Zeppelin to avoid a mispronunciation as Leed Zeppelin.\n\n1968\u20131980: Led Zeppelin\nLed Zeppelin are one of the bestselling music groups in the history of audio recording. Various sources estimate the groups worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 1115 million RIAAcertified units they are the secondbestselling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart and six reached the numberone spotLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock and their sound was largely the product of Pages input as a producer and musician. The bands individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple recordbreaking concert tours which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful in the later 1970s the bands output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be from the very beginning\n\nI had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses  a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Pages home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar grieving for his friend. For the rest of the 1980s his work consisted of a series of shortterm collaborations in the bands the Firm the Honeydrippers reunions and individual work including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n1980s\nPage made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the Hammersmith Odeon. Also in 1981, Page joined with Yes bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White to form a supergroup called XYZ for former YesZeppelin. They rehearsed several times but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects notably The Firms Fortune Hunter and Yes songs Mind Drive and Can You Imagine?. Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund Germany playing Im Down.\nIn 1982, Page collaborated with director Michael Winner to record the Death Wish II soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings including the Death Wish III soundtrack were recorded and produced at his recording studio The Sol in Cookham which he had purchased from Gus Dudgeon in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Page appeared with the ARMS. Action Research for Multiple Sclerosis charity series of concerts which honoured Small Faces bassist Ronnie Lane who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London Pages set consisted of songs from the Death Wish II soundtrack with Steve Winwood on vocals and an instrumental version of Stairway to Heaven. A fourcity tour of the United States followed with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company replacing Winwood. During the tour Page and Rodgers performed Midnight Moonlight which would later appear on The Firms first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of Layla that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book Hammer of the Gods it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\nPage next linked up with Roy Harper for the 1984 album Whatever Happened to Jugula? and occasional concerts performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album The Honeydrippers Volume 1 and with John Paul Jones on the film soundtrack Scream for Help.\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name The Firm. The first album released in 1985, was the selftitled The Firm. Popular songs included Radioactive and Satisfaction Guaranteed. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by Mean Business in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums but soon split up.\nVarious other projects followed such as session work for Graham Nash Stephen Stills and the Rolling Stones on their 1986 single One Hit To the Body. In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the Box of Frogs album Strange Land. Page released a solo album entitled Outrider in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant with Page contributing in turn to Plants solo album Now and Zen which was released the same year. Outrider also featured singer John Miles on the albums opening track Wasting My Time.Throughout these years Page also reunited with the other former bandmates of Led Zeppelin to perform live on a few occasions most notably in 1985 for the Live Aid concert with both Phil Collins and Tony Thompson filling drum duties. However the band members considered this performance to be substandard with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page Plant and Jones as well as John Bonhams son Jason performed at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.\n\n1990s CoverdalePage Page and Plant\nIn 1990, a Knebworth concert to aid the NordoffRobbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform Misty Mountain Hop Wearing and Tearing and Rock and Roll.

In the same year Page played guitar for rap singerproducer Puff Daddys song Come with Me which heavily samples Led Zeppelins Kashmir and was included in the soundtrack of Godzilla. The two later performed the song on Saturday Night Live.\nFollowing a benefit performance in the summer where the Black Crowes guested with him Page teamed up with the band for six shows in October 1999, playing material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The last two concerts were recorded in Los Angeles and released as a double live album Live at the Greek in 2000.\n\n2000s\nFollowing the release of the live album Page and the Black Crowes continued their collaboration by joining a package tour with the Who in 2000, which Page ultimately quit before completionIn 2001, after guesting with Fred Durst and Wes Scantlins performance of Thank You at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards Page once again continued his collaboration with Robert Plant. After recording a cover of My Buckets Got a Hole in It for a tribute album the duo performed at the Montreux Jazz FestivalIn 2005, Page was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire OBE in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazils Childrens Trust made an honorary citizen of Rio de Janeiro later that year and won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award with Led ZeppelinIn November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame.

After this rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin.  During an interview for the BBC in connection with the induction Page expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying Its an album that I really need to get out of my system ... theres a good album in there and its ready to come out and Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon.\nOn 10 December 2007, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin as well as John Bonhams son Jason Bonham played a charity concert at the O2 Arena London.

In a spring 2014 interview with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelins first three albums Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show but Plant later replied that the chances of it happening were zero. Page then told The New York Times that he was fed up with Plants refusal to play stating I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. Hes just playing games and Im fed up with it to be honest with you. I dont sing so I cant do much about it adding I definitely want to play live. Because you know Ive still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So yeah Ill just get myself into musical shape just concentrating on the guitar.In July 2014, an NME article revealed that Plant was slightly disappointed and baffled by Page in ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute during which Page declared he was fed up with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans. Instead Plant offered Led Zeppelins guitarist to write acoustically with him as he is interested in working with Page again but only in an unplugged wayIn September 2014, Page  who has not toured as a solo act since 1988  announced that he would start a new band and perform material spanning his entire career. He spoke about his prospects for hitting the road saying I havent put musicians together yet but Im going to do that next year ie. 2015]. If I went out to play I would play material that spanned everything from my recording career right back to my very very early days with The Yardbirds. There would certainly be some new material in there as well ....In December 2015, Page was featured in the twohour long BBC Radio 2 programme Johnny Walker Meets in conversation with DJ Johnny Walker.

His experiences in the studio and with the Yardbirds were key to the success of Led Zeppelin. As a producer songwriter and guitarist he helped make Zeppelin a prototype for countless bands and was one of the major driving forces behind the rock sound of that era influencing a host of guitaristsGuitarists influenced by Page include Eddie Van Halen Ace Frehley Joe Satriani John Frusciante Kirk Hammett Joe Perry Richie SamboraSlash Dave Mustaine Mick Mars Alex Lifeson Steve Vai Dan Hawkins and Char among others.

A Harmony Sovereign H1260 was used instudio on Led Zeppelin III and Led Zeppelin IV and onstage from 5 March 1971 to 28 June 1972. During the studio sessions for Led Zeppelin and later for recording the guitar solo in Stairway to Heaven he used a Fender Telecaster a gift from Jeff Beck. He also used a Danelectro 3021, tuned to DADGAD most notably on live performances of Kashmir.\nPage also plays his guitar with a cello bow as on the live versions of the songs Dazed and Confused and How Many More Times. This was a technique he developed during his session days. On MTVs Led Zeppelin Rockumentary Page said that he obtained the idea of playing the guitar with a bow from David McCallum Sr. who was also a session musician.

After the dissolution of the Yardbirds Page removed the mirrors from the guitar stripped the finish and applied a dragon design himself.\n\nOther instruments\nTheremin\nPage frequently employed a scaleddown version of the Theremin known as the Sonic Wave first using the instrument during live performances with the Yardbirds. As a member of Led Zeppelin Page played the Sonic Wave on the studio recordings of Whole Lotta Love and No Quarter and frequently played the instrument at the bands live showsHurdygurdy\nPage owns two hurdygurdies and is shown playing one of the instruments in the 1976 film The Song Remains the Same. The second hurdygurdy owned by Page was produced by Christopher Eaton father of renowned English hurdygurdist Nigel Eaton.\n\nAmplifiers and effects\nPage usually recorded in studio with assorted amplifiers by Vox Axis Fender and Orange amplification. Live he used Hiwatt and Marshall amplification. The first Led Zeppelin album was played on a Fender Telecaster through a Supro amplifierPage used a limited number of effects including a Maestro Echoplex a Dunlop Cry Baby an MXR Phase 90, a Vox Cry Baby Wah a Boss CE2 Chorus a Yamaha CH10Mk II Chorus a Sola Sound Tone Bender Professional Mk II an MXR Blue Box distortionoctaver and a DigiTech Whammy.\n\nMusic production techniques\nPage is credited for the innovations in sound recording he brought to the studio during the years he was a member of Led Zeppelin many of which he had initially developed as a session musician\nThis apprenticeship ... became a part of learning how things were recorded. I started to learn microphone placements and things like that what did and what didnt work. I certainly knew what did and didnt work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument it relies on having a bright room and a live room ... And so bit by bit I was learning really how not to record.\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s most British music producers placed microphones directly in front of amplifiers and drums resulting in the sometimes tinny sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to Guitar World magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular sounded like cardboard boxes. Instead Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques Sun Studio being a particular favourite. In the same Guitar World interview Page remarked Recording used to be a science and engineers used to have a maxim distance equals depth. Taking this maxim to heart Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier as much as twenty feet and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique Page became one of the first British producers to record a bands ambient sound  the distance of a notes timelag from one end of the room to the otherFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks such as Whole Lotta Love and You Shook Me Page additionally utilised reverse echo  a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single Ten Little Indians. This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\nPage has stated that as producer he deliberately changed the audio engineers on Led Zeppelin albums from Glyn Johns for the first album to Eddie Kramer for Led Zeppelin II to Andy Johns for Led Zeppelin III and later albums. He explained I consciously kept changing engineers because I didnt want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.John Paul Jones acknowledged that Pages production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin\n\nThe backwards echo stuff and a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distancemiking ... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers but Page doesnt. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well so that it fits into a sonic picture.\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to Guitar World magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer\n\nMany people think of me as just a riff guitarist but I think of myself in broader terms ... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career. I think I really captured the best of our output growth change and maturity on tape  the multifaceted gem that is Led Zeppelin.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships\nDuring the 1960s Page was with American recording artist Jackie DeShannon who is cited as a possible inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording Tangerine.French model Charlotte Martin was Pages partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her My Lady and together they had a daughter Scarlet Page born in 1971) who is a photographer.\nAlso during the 1970s Page had a welldocumented oneyearlong relationship with baby groupie Lori Mattix also known as Lori Maddox beginning when she was 14 or 15 and while he was an adult of 28. Mattix describes her first meeting with Page starting by being approached by Peter Grant and taken to a room with Page as feeling like I was being kidnapped. In light of the Me Too movement four decades later their relationship attracted renewed attentionFrom 1986 to 1995, Page was married to Patricia Ecker a model and waitress. They have a son James Patrick Page born April 1988). Page later married Jimena G\u00f3mezParatcha whom he met in Brazil on the No Quarter tour. He adopted her oldest daughter Jana born 1994) and they have two children together Zofia Jade born 1997) and Ashen Josan born 1999). Page and G\u00f3mezParatcha divorced in 2008Page has been in a relationship with actress and poet Scarlett Sabet since August 2014.\n\nProperties\nIn 1967, when Page was still with The Yardbirds he purchased the Thames Boathouse on the River Thames in Pangbourne Berkshire and resided there until 1973. The Boathouse was also the place where Page and Plant first officially got together in the summer of 1968 and Led Zeppelin was formedIn 1972, Page bought the Tower House from Richard Harris. It was the home that William Burges 1827\u201381) had designed for himself in London. I had an interest going back to my teens in the preRaphaelite movement and the architecture of Burges Page said. What a wonderful world to discover. The reputation of Burges rests on his extravagant designs and his contribution to the Gothic revival in architecture in the nineteenth centuryFrom 1980 to 2004 Page owned the Mill House Mill Lane Windsor which was formerly the home of actor Michael Caine. Fellow Led Zeppelin band member John Bonham died at the house in 1980.\nFrom the early 1970s to the early 1990s Page owned the Boleskine House the former residence of occultist Aleister Crowley. Sections of Pages fantasy sequence in the film The Song Remains the Same were filmed at night on the mountainside directly behind Boleskine House.\nPage also previously owned Plumpton Place in Sussex formerly owned by Edward Hudson the owner of Country Life magazine and with certain parts of the house designed by Edwin Lutyens. This house features in the Zeppelin film The Song Remains The Same where Page is seen sitting on the lawn playing a hurdygurdy.\nHe currently resides in Sonning Berkshire in Deanery Garden a house also designed by Edwin Lutyens for Edward Hudson.\n\nRecreational drug use\nPage has acknowledged heavy recreational drug use throughout the 1970s. In an interview with Guitar World magazine in 2003, he stated I cant speak for the other members of the band but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing right from the beginning right to the end. After the bands 1973 North American tour Page told Nick Kent Oh everyone went over the top a few times. I know I did and to be honest with you I dont really remember much of what happened.In 1975, Page began to use heroin according to Richard Cole.  Cole claims that he and Page took the drug during the recording sessions of the album Presence and Page admitted shortly afterward that he was addicted to the drugBy Led Zeppelins 1977 North American tour Pages heroin addiction was beginning to hamper his guitar playing performances. By this time the guitarist had lost a noticeable amount of weight. His onstage appearance was not the only obvious change his addiction caused Page to become so inward and isolated it altered the dynamics between him and Plant considerably. During the recording sessions for In Through the Out Door in 1978, Pages diminished influence on the album relative to bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones is partly attributed to his heroin addiction which resulted in his absence from the studio for long periods of timePage reportedly overcame his heroin habit in the early 1980s although he was arrested for possession of cocaine in both 1982 and 1984. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge in 1982 and despite a second offence usually carrying a jail sentence he was only finedIn a 1988 interview with Musician magazine Page took offence when the interviewer noted that heroin had been associated with his name and insisted Do I look as if Im a smack addict? Well Im not. Thank you very much.In an interview he gave to Q magazine in 2003, Page responded to a question as to whether he regrets getting so involved in heroin and cocaine\n\nI dont regret it at all because when I needed to be really focused I was really focused. Thats it. Both Presence and In Through the Out Door were only recorded in three weeks thats really going some. Youve got to be on top of it.\n\nInterest in the occult\nPages interest in the occult started as a schoolboy at the age of fifteen when he read English occultists Aleister Crowleys Magick in Theory and Practice. He later said that following this discovery he thought Yes thats it. My thing Ive found it.The appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelins fourth album has been linked to Pages interest in the occult. The four symbols represented each member of the band. Pages own socalled Zoso symbol originated in Ars Magica Arteficii 1557) by Gerolamo Cardano an old alchemical grimoire where it has been identified as a sigil consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in Dictionary of Occult Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils by Fred GettingsDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album Page often had the Zoso symbol embroidered on his clothes along with zodiac symbols. These were visible most notably on his Dragon Suit which included the signs for Capricorn Scorpio and Cancer which are Pages Sun Ascendant and Moon signs respectively.  The Zoso symbol also appeared on Pages amplifiers.\nThe artwork inside the album cover of Led Zeppelin IV is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby influenced by the traditional RiderWaite Tarot card design for the card called The Hermit. Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting. Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelins concert film The Song Remains the Same.\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers at 4 Holland Street in Kensington London named after Crowleys biannual magazine The Equinox. The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs with Crowleys birth chart affixed to a wall. Pages reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward\n\nThere was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.\nThe company published two books a facsimile of Crowleys 1904 edition of The Goetia and Astrology A Cosmic Science by Isabel Hickey. The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said It obviously wasnt going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes and I didnt really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus thats all.Page has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained\n\nI feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up lead to frustration which leads to violence crime mental breakdown depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age were in now gets into technology and alienation a lot of the points hes made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ... Im not saying its a system for anybody to follow. I dont agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and its those things that people attacked him on so he was misunderstood. ... Im not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of selfliberation which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive but I dont particularly want to go into it because its a personal thing and isnt in relation to anything apart from the fact that Ive employed his system in my own day to day life. ... The thing is to come to terms with ones free will discover ones place and what one is and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. Its very basically coming to terms with yourself.\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film Lucifer Rising by Crowley admirer and underground movie director Kenneth Anger. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of droning. The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a dabbler in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project. Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks. Side one contained Lucifer Rising  Main Track whilst side two contained the tracks Incubus Damask Unharmonics Damask  Ambient and Lucifer Rising   Percussive Return. In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story Jimmy Page Looks Back Page said ... there was a request suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley he has never described himself as a Thelemite nor was he ever initiated into the OTO. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\nDiscography\nWith Led Zeppelin\n\nLed Zeppelin 1969)\nLed Zeppelin II 1969)\nLed Zeppelin III 1970)\nUntitled album 1971) de facto Led Zeppelin IV\nHouses of the Holy 1973)\nPhysical Graffiti 1975)\nPresence 1976)\nIn Through the Out Door 1979)\nCoda 1982)With Roy Harper\n\nWhatever Happened to Jugula? 1985)With the Firm\n\nThe Firm 1985)\nMean Business 1986)Solo\n\nOutrider 1988)With CoverdalePage\n\nCoverdalePage 1993)with Page and Plant\nWalking into Clarksdale 1998)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Quotations related to Jimmy Page at Wikiquote\nOfficial website\nOfficial Led Zeppelin site\nJimmy Page at IMDb\nJimmy Page discography at Discogs \nJimmy Page by Jimmy Page  Genesis Publications Limited Edition Book\nNYTimes interview 2015\n Jimmy Page How Stairway to Heaven was written  BBC News on YouTube", "Francisco de As\u00eds T\u00e1rrega Eixea 21 November 1852  15 December 1909) was a Spanish composer and classical guitarist of the late Romantic period. He is known for such pieces as Capricho \u00c1rabe and Recuerdos de la Alhambra.\n\nBiography\nT\u00e1rrega was born on 21 November 1852, in Villarreal Province of Castell\u00f3n Spain. It is said that Franciscos father played flamenco and several other music styles on his guitar when his father was away working as a watchman at the Convent of San Pascual Francisco would take his fathers guitar and attempt to make the beautiful sounds he had heard. Franciscos nickname as a child was Quiquet.\nAs a child he ran away from his nanny and fell into an irrigation channel and injured his eyes. Fearing that his son might lose his sight completely his father moved the family to Castell\u00f3n de la Plana to attend music classes because as a musician he would be able to earn a living even if blind. Both his first music teachers Eugeni Ruiz and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez were blind.\nIn 1862, concert guitarist Juli\u00e1n Arcas on tour in Castell\u00f3n heard the young T\u00e1rrega play and advised T\u00e1rregas father to allow Francisco to come to Barcelona to study with him. T\u00e1rregas father agreed but insisted that his son take piano lessons as well. The guitar was viewed as an instrument to accompany singers while the piano was quite popular throughout Europe. However T\u00e1rrega had to stop his lessons shortly after when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although T\u00e1rrega was only ten years old he ran away and tried to start a musical career on his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was soon found and brought back to his father who had to make great sacrifices to advance his sons musical education.\nThree years later in 1865, he ran away again this time to Valencia where he joined a Romani family. His father looked for him and brought him back home once more but he ran away a third time again to Valencia. By his early teens T\u00e1rrega was proficient on both the piano and the guitar. For a time he played with other musicians at local engagements to earn money but eventually he returned home to help his family.\nT\u00e1rrega entered the Madrid Royal Conservatory in 1874, under the sponsorship of a wealthy merchant named Antonio Canesa. He had brought along with him a recently purchased guitar made in Seville by Antonio de Torres. Its superior sonic qualities inspired him both in his playing and in his view of the instruments compositional potential. At the conservatory T\u00e1rrega studied composition under Emilio Arrieta who convinced him to focus on guitar and abandon the idea of a career with the piano.\nBy the end of the 1870s T\u00e1rrega was teaching the guitar Emilio Pujol Miguel Llobet and Daniel Fortea were pupils of his and giving regular concerts. T\u00e1rrega received much acclaim for his playing and began traveling to other areas of Spain to perform. By this time he was composing his first works for guitar which he played in addition to works of other composers.\nDuring the winter of 1880, T\u00e1rrega replaced his friend Luis de Soria in a concert in Novelda Alicante where after the concert an important man in town asked the artist to listen to his daughter Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rizo who was learning to play guitar. Soon they were engaged.\nIn 1881, T\u00e1rrega played in the Opera Theatre in Lyon and then the Paris Odeon in the bicentenary of the death of Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. He also played in London where he liked neither the language nor the weather. There is a story about his visit to England after a concert some people saw that the musician was in low spirits. What is the matter maestro? they asked him. Do you miss home? Your family perhaps? They advised him to capture that moment of sadness in his music. Thus he conceived the theme of one of his most memorable works L\u00e1grima teardrop. After playing in London he returned to Novelda for his wedding. At Christmas 1882, T\u00e1rrega married Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rizo.\n\nTo enlarge his guitar repertory and to make use of his considerable knowledge of keyboard music he soon began transcribing piano works of Beethoven Chopin Mendelssohn and others. T\u00e1rrega and his wife moved to Madrid gaining their living by teaching privately and playing concerts but after the death of an infant daughter during the winter Maria Josefa de los Angeles T\u00e1rrega Rizo they settled permanently in Barcelona in 1885. Among his friends in Barcelona were Isaac Alb\u00e9niz Enrique Granados Joaqu\u00edn Turina and Pau Casals.\n\nFrancisco T\u00e1rrega and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Josefa Rizo had three more children Paquito Francisco Maria Rosatia Mar\u00eda Rosalia best known as Marieta and Concepci\u00f3n. On a concert tour in Valencia shortly afterward T\u00e1rrega met the wealthy Concepci\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de Jacoby who became a valuable patron to him. She allowed him and his family use of part of her house outside Barcelona. Later she took him to Granada which later inspired the guitarist to write Recuerdos de la Alhambra which he first dedicated to Concepci\u00f3n in 1899 with the title A Granada. He later dedicated a revised published version of this piece to Alfred Cottin the French guitarist he had met in Paris while participating in a concert on a visit accompanied and almost certainly sponsored by G\u00f3mez de Jacoby.\nFrom the later 1880s up to 1903, T\u00e1rrega continued composing and traveling but limited his concerts to Spain. In 1900, T\u00e1rrega visited Algiers where he was said to have heard a repetitive rhythm played on an Arabian drum and the following morning composed Danza Mora based on that rhythm. In about 1902, he cut his fingernails and created a sound that would become typical of those guitarists later associated with his school. The following year he went on tour to Italy performing in Rome Naples and Milan.\nIn January 1906, he was afflicted with paralysis on his right side and though he would eventually return to performing he never completely recovered. He finished his last work Oremus on 2 December 1909. He died in Barcelona thirteen days later on 15 December at the age of 57.\n\nMusical style\nT\u00e1rrega composed music in the romantic style of 19thcentury European masters. His conservatory training and familiarity with contemporary classical genres and techniques are apparent in his compositions and transcriptions these are more sophisticated than those of Spanish guitaristcomposers of the previous generation and his contemporaries eg Mag\u00edn Alegre Tom\u00e1s Damas Juli\u00e1n Arcas Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1as and Jos\u00e9 Ferrer.\nA virtuoso on his instrument he was known as the Sarasate of the guitar although T\u00e1rrega preferred small intimate performances over the concert stage.\nT\u00e1rrega is considered to have laid the foundations for 20thcentury classical guitar and for increasing interest in the guitar as a recital instrument.\n\nCompositions\nAlthough only 19 original compositions were published in his lifetime Francisco T\u00e1rrega composed approximately 80 original pieces and 120 transcriptions  mostly for his own use and that of his students. Most of his later published works were edited by others and often altered. His favored genres were character pieces several with Spanish Moorish and Arabic allusions including preludes etudes caprices serenades and dances.\nHe transcribed many works from the piano he was a capable keyboard player violin and the operatic repertory. \nAs with several of his Spanish contemporaries such as his friend Isaac Alb\u00e9niz he had an interest in combining the prevailing romantic style in classical music with Spanish folk elements and transcribed several of Alb\u00e9nizs piano pieces. \nHe also the composer of Gran Vals an excerpt of which was used in the Nokia tune the default ringtone of Nokia phones. It appears on these phones in a variety of different styles and instrumentations for example phones from 2002 to 2007 include pianobased renditions while phones released during 2008 to 2010 feature a folkinspired guitar rendition.\nIn 2015, the Italian violist Marco Misciagna published his arrangements for solo viola of the Tango Capricho \u00e1rabe and Recuerdos de la Alhambra.\n\nGuitars\nThe guitars used by T\u00e1rrega include\n\nEnrique Garcia n74 1906)  This instrument was gifted by T\u00e1rrega to his friend Alfred Cottin to whom he dedicated the composition Recuerdos de la Alhambra. It then became the official guitar of Les Amis de la Guitare a circle of Parisian guitarists where it was played by Django Reinhardt among others. In 2019 Kyuhee Park recorded a video of Recuerdos de la Alhambra on this guitar.

T\u00e1rrega", "Charles Edward Anderson Berry October 18, 1926  March 18, 2017) was an American singer guitarist and songwriter who pioneered rock and roll. Nicknamed the Father of Rock and Roll he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as Maybellene 1955) Roll Over Beethoven 1956) Rock and Roll Music 1957) and Johnny B. Goode 1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock musicBorn into a middleclass black family in St. Louis Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician TBone Walker Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact Leonard Chess of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded MaybelleneBerrys adaptation of the country song Ida Redwhich sold over a million copies reaching number one on Billboard magazines rhythm and blues chartBy the end of the 1950s Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub Berrys Club Bandstand. He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Acthe had transported a 14-yearold girl across state lines for the purpose of having sexual intercourse. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs including No Particular Place to Go You Never Can Tell and Nadine. However these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. In 1972, he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of My DingaLing became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a fourmonth jail sentence and community service for tax evasion.\nBerry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance. Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazines greatest of all time lists he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 2nd greatest guitarist of all time in 2023. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fames 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berrys Johnny B. Goode Maybellene and Rock and Roll Music. Johnny B. Goode is the only rockandroll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in St. Louis Berry was the youngest child. He grew up in the north St. Louis neighborhood known as the Ville an area where many middleclass people lived. His father Henry William Berry 1895\u20131987) was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church his mother Martha Bell Banks 1894\u20131980) was a certified public school principal. Berrys upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City Missouri and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berrys account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa near Jefferson City Missouri where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.\nOn October 28, 1948, Berry married Themetta Toddy Suggs who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3, 1950. Berry supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived. Afterwards he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology founded by Annie Turnbo Malone. He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a small three room brick cottage with a bath on Whittier Street which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic PlacesBy the early 1950s Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He had been playing blues since his teens and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician TBone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris which laid the foundation for his guitar styleBy early 1953, Berry was performing with Johnnie Johnsons trio starting a longtime collaboration with the pianist. The band played blues and ballads as well as country. Berry wrote Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo? After they laughed at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it.In 1954, Berry recorded the tracks I Hope These Words Will Find You Well and Oh Maria! with the group Joe Alexander  the Cubans. The songs were released as a single on the Ballad labelBerrys showmanship along with a mix of country tunes and RB tunes sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters brought in a wider audience particularly affluent white people.\n\nCareer\n1955\u20131962: Signing with Chess Maybellene to Come On\nIn May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago where he met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact Leonard Chess of Chess Records. Berry thought his blues music would interest Chess but Chess was a larger fan of Berrys take on Ida Red. On May 21, 1955, Berry recorded an adaptation of the song Ida Red under the title Maybellene with Johnnie Johnson on the piano Jerome Green from Bo Diddleys band on the maracas Ebby Hardy on the drums and Willie Dixon on the bass. Maybellene sold over a million copies reaching number one on Billboard magazines rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10, 1955. Berry said It came out at the right time when AfroAmerican music was spilling over into the mainstream pop.When Berry first saw a copy of the Maybellene record he was surprised that two other individuals including DJ Alan Freed had been given writing credit that would entitle them to some of the royalties. After a court battle Berry was able to regain full writing creditAt the end of June 1956, his song Roll Over Beethoven reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart and Berry toured as one of the Top Acts of 56\". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that I knew when I first heard Chuck that hed been affected by country music. I respected his writing his records were very very great. In late 1957, Berry took part in Alan Freeds Biggest Show of Stars for 1957\" touring the United States with the Everly Brothers Buddy Holly and others. He was a guest on ABCs Guy Mitchell Show singing his hit song Rock n Roll Music. The hits continued from 1957 to 1959, with Berry scoring over a dozen chart singles during this period including the US Top 10 hits School Days Rock and Roll Music Sweet Little Sixteen and Johnny B. Goode. He appeared in two early rockandroll movies Rock Rock Rock 1956) in which he sang You Cant Catch Me and Go Johnny Go! 1959) in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed Johnny B. Goode Memphis Tennessee and Little Queenie. His performance of Sweet Little Sixteen at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 was captured in the motion picture Jazz on a Summers Day.\nThe opening guitar riff of Johnny B. Goode is similar to the one used by Louis Jordan in his Aint That Just Like a Woman 1946). Berry acknowledged the debt to Jordan and several sources have indicated that his work was influenced by Jordan in generalBy the end of the 1950s Berry was a highprofile established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub Berrys Club Bandstand and invested in real estate. But in December 1959, he was arrested under the Mann Act after allegations that he had had sexual intercourse with a 14-yearold Apache waitress Janice Escalante whom he had transported across state lines to work as a hatcheck girl at his club. After a twoweek trial in March 1960, he was convicted fined 5,000, and sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the decision arguing that the judges comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him. The appeal was upheld and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961, resulting in another conviction and a threeyear prison sentence. After another appeal failed Berry served one and onehalf years in prison from February 1962 to October 1963. He had continued recording and performing during the trials but his output had slowed as his popularity declined his final single released before he was imprisoned was Come On.\n\n1963\u20131969: Nadine and move to Mercury\nWhen Berry was released from prison in 1963, his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bandsnotably the Beatles and the Rolling Stoneshad sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs and other bands had reworked some of them such as the Beach Boys 1963 hit Surfin USA. which used the melody of Berrys Sweet Little Sixteen. In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles including three that were commercially successful reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 100: No Particular Place to Go a humorous reworking of School Days concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars You Never Can Tell and the rocking Nadine. Between 1966 and 1969, Berry released five albums for Mercury Records including his second live album and first recorded entirely onstage Live at Fillmore Auditorium for the live album he was backed by the Steve Miller BandAlthough this period was not a successful one for studio work Berry was still a top concert draw. In May 1964, he had made a successful tour of the UK but when he returned in January 1965, his behavior was erratic and moody and his touring style of using unrehearsed local backing bands and a strict nonnegotiable contract was earning him a reputation as a difficult and unexciting performer. He also played at large events in North America such as the Schaefer Music Festival in New York Citys Central Park in July 1969, and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in October.\n\n1970\u20131979: Back to Chess My DingaLing to White House concert\nBerry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were no hit singles from the 1970 album Back Home but in 1972, Chess released a live recording of My DingaLing a novelty song which he had recorded in a different version as My Tambourine on his 1968 LP From St. Louie to Frisco. The track became his only numberone single. A live recording of Reelin and Rockin issued as a followup single in the same year was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the partlive partstudio album The London Chuck Berry Sessions other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chesss mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf. Berrys second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album Chuck Berry after which he did not make a studio record until Rockit for Atco Records in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.\nIn the 1970s Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years carrying only his Gibson guitar confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. AllMusic said that in this period his live performances became increasingly erratic ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy outoftune performances which tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers alike. In March 1972, he was filmed at the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherds Bush for Chuck Berry in Concert part of a 60-date tour backed by the band Rocking Horse. Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each was just starting his career. Springsteen related in the documentary film Hail! Hail! Rock n Roll that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry did not speak to the band after the show. Nevertheless Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 At the request of Jimmy Carter Berry performed at the White House on June 1, 1979Berrys touring style traveling the oldies circuit in the 1970s often being paid in cash by local promoters added ammunition to the Internal Revenue Services accusations that Berry had evaded paying income taxes.

With songs such as Maybellene 1955) Roll Over Beethoven 1956) Rock and Roll Music 1957) and Johnny B. Goode 1958) Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances fast cars high school life and consumer culture and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.  Thus Berry the songwriter according to critic Jon Pareles invented rock as a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times even with cops in pursuit.  Berry contributed three things to rock music an irresistible swagger a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling. His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical showmanship and musical components of rock and roll. In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones a large number of significant popularmusic performers have recorded Berrys songs. Although not technically accomplished his guitar style is distinctivehe incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan and TBone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style. Berrys showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists particularly his onelegged hop routine and the duck walk which he first used as a child when he walked stooping with fullbended knees but with my back and head vertical under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining he used it when performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk.On July 29, 2011, Berry was honored in a dedication of an eightfoot inmotion Chuck Berry Statue in the Delmar Loop in St. Louis right across the street from Blueberry Hill.  Berry said Its gloriousI do appreciate it to the highest no doubt about it.  That sort of honor is seldom given out.  But I dont deserve it.Rock critic Robert Christgau considers Berry the greatest of the rock and rollers and John Lennon said if you tried to give rock and roll another name you might call it Chuck Berry. Ted Nugent said If you dont know every Chuck Berry lick you cant play rock guitar. Bob Dylan called Berry the Shakespeare of rock n roll. Bruce Springsteen tweeted Chuck Berry was rocks greatest practitioner guitarist and the greatest pure rock n roll writer who ever lived.When asked what caused the explosion of the popularity of rock n roll that took place in the 1950s with him and a handful of others mainly him Berry said Well actually they begin to listen to it you see because certain stations played certain music. The music that we the blacks played the cultures were so far apart we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together and you begin to see one anothers vein of life then the music came together.\nAmong the honors Berry received were the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000. He was ranked seventh on Time magazines 2009 list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. On May 14, 2002, Berry was honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards. He was presented the award along with BMI affiliates Bo Diddley and Little Richard. In August 2014, Berry was made a laureate of the Polar Music PrizeBerry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazines Greatest of All Time lists. In September 2003, the magazine ranked him number 6 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In November his compilation album The Great TwentyEight was ranked 21st in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In March 2004, Berry was ranked fifth on the list of The Immortals  The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.  Joe Perry wrote in tribute As a songwriter Chuck Berry is like the Ernest Hemingway of rock  roll. He gets right to the point. He tells a story in short sentences. You get a great picture in your mind of whats going on in a very short amount of space in wellpicked words ... kids today are playing the same three chords trying to play in that same style. Turn the guitars up and its punk rock. Its the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. I hear it in the White Stripes too. People will always cover Chuck Berry songs. When bands go do their homework they will have to listen to Chuck Berry. If you want to learn about rock  roll if you want to play rock  roll you have to start there. In December 2004, six of his songs were included in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Johnny B. Goode 7) Maybellene 18) Roll Over Beethoven 97) Rock and Roll Music 128) Sweet Little Sixteen 272) and Brown Eyed Handsome Man 374). In June 2008, his song Johnny B. Goode was ranked first in the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Berry at number 96 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All TimeThe journalist Chuck Klosterman has argued that in 300 years Berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll. Time magazine stated There was no one like Elvis. But there was definitely no one like Chuck Berry. Rolling Stone called him the father of rock  roll who gave the music its sound and its attitude even as he battled racismand his own misdeedsall the way reporting that Leonard Cohen said All of us are footnotes to the words of Chuck Berry. Kevin Strait curator of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC said that Berry is one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll.According to Clevelandcoms Troy L. Smith Chuck Berry didnt invent rock and roll all by his lonesome. But he was the man who took rhythm and blues and transformed it into a new genre that would ever change popular music. Songs like Maybellene Johnny B. Goode Roll Over Beethoven and Rock and Roll Music would showcase the core elements of what rock and roll would become. The sound the format and the style were built on the music Berry created. To some extent everyone who followed was a copycat.In 2020, the International Astronomical Union named a small crater on Mercury after Berry.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nReferences\nCitations\nGeneral and cited sources\nFurther reading\nChristgau Robert March 22, 2017).

Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan.\nBorn and raised in Dallas Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven initially inspired by his brother Jimmie. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978. The band established itself in the Austin music scene and soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. They performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1982, where David Bowie saw Vaughan play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig in December where he played blues guitar on the album Lets Dance 1983). John Hammond heard a demo album that Vaughan and Double Trouble had recorded and interested major label Epic Records in signing them to a record deal in March 1983. Within months they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album Texas Flood. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.\nVaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction for most of his life. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora Lenny Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album In Step reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughans most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only numberone hit Crossfire. He became one of the worlds most popular blues performers and he headlined Madison Square Garden in 1989 and the Beale Street Music Festival in 1990.\nOn August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were killed in a helicopter crash in East Troy Wisconsin after performing with Double Trouble at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error. Vaughans music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. Rolling Stone has twice ranked him among the top twenty guitar players of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton Tommy Shannon and Reese Wynans.\n\nFamily and early life\nVaughans grandfather Thomas Lee Vaughan married Laura Belle LaRue and moved to Rockwall County Texas where they lived by sharecroppingStevies father Jimmie Lee Vaughan was born on September 6, 1921. Jimmie Vaughan also known as Jim or Big Jim dropped out of school at age sixteen and enlisted in the US. Navy during World War II. After his discharge from the military he married Martha Jean n\u00e9e Cook 1928\u20132009) on January 13, 1950. They had a son Jimmie in 1951. Stevie was born at Methodist Hospital on October 3, 1954, in Dallas. Big Jim secured a job as an asbestos worker. The family moved frequently and lived in other states such as Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. His father struggled with alcohol abuse and often terrorized his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of his fathers violence. His father died on August 27, 1986, exactly four years before Vaughan himself.\n\nFirst instruments\nIn the early 1960s Vaughans admiration for his brother Jimmie resulted in his trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone. In 1961, for his seventh birthday Vaughan received his first guitar a toy guitar from Sears with a Western motif. Learning by ear he diligently committed himself following along to songs by the Nightcaps particularly Wine Wine Wine and Thunderbird. He listened to blues artists such as Albert King Otis Rush and Muddy Waters and rock guitarists including Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack as well as jazz guitarists including Kenny Burrell. In 1963, he acquired his first electric guitar a Gibson ES125T as a handmedown from JimmieSoon after he acquired the electric guitar Vaughan joined his first band the Chantones in 1965. Their first show was at a talent contest held in Dallas Hill Theatre but after realizing that they could not perform a Jimmy Reed song in its entirety Vaughan left the band and joined the Brooklyn Underground playing professionally at local bars and clubs. He received Jimmies Fender Broadcaster which he later traded for an Epiphone Riviera. When Jimmie left home at age sixteen Vaughans apparent obsession with the guitar caused a lack of support from his parents. Miserable at home he took a job at a local hamburger stand where he washed dishes and dumped trash for seventy cents an hour. After falling into a barrel of grease he grew tired of the job and quit to devote his life to a music career.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nIn May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned the Yardbirds Jeffs Boogie and played the song at the band audition. Mike Steinbach the groups drummer commented The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on Jeffs Boogie really fast instrumental guitar and he played it note for note. Although they played pop rock covers Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the groups repertoire he was told that he wouldnt earn a living playing blues music and he and the band parted ways. Later that year bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing which he described as incredible even then Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years they began performing together in a band called KrackerjackIn February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation which was a ninepiece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughans guitar playing Scott Phares the groups original guitarist modestly became the bassist. In mid1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberations break Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song Thunderbird. Phares later described the performance they tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s Vaughans latenight shows contributed to his neglect of his studies including music theory he would often sleep during class. His pursuit of a musical career was disapproved of by many of the schools administrators but he was also encouraged by many people including his art teacher to strive for a career in art. In his second year he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University but left when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and recalled having  received daily notes from the principal about his grooming.\n\nFirst recordings\nIn September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands which included future actor Stephen Tobolowsky. They recorded two songs Red White and Blue and I Heard a Voice Last Night for a compilation album A New Hi that featured various teenage bands from Dallas. In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation Vaughan formed his own band Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene he dropped out of school and moved with the band to Austin Texas which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Club a local blues venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as Sugarloaf Wishbone Ash and Zephyr but could not maintain a consistent lineup. In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined Krackerjack he performed with them for less than three monthsIn March 1973, Vaughan joined Marc Bennos band the Nightcrawlers having met Benno at a jam session years before. The band featured vocalist Doyle Bramhall who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old. The next month the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood for AM Records. While the album was rejected by AM it included Vaughans first songwriting efforts Dirty Pool and Crawlin. Soon afterward he and the Nightcrawlers traveled back to Austin without Benno. In mid1973, they signed a contract with Bill Ham manager for ZZ Top and played various gigs across the Southern United States although many of them were unsuccessful. Ham left the band stranded in Mississippi without any way to make it back home and demanded reimbursement from Vaughan for equipment expenses Ham was never reimbursedIn 1975, Vaughan joined a sixpiece band called Paul Ray and the Cobras which included guitarist Denny Freeman and saxophonist Joe Sublett. For the next twoandahalf years he earned a living performing weekly at a popular venue in town the Soap Creek Saloon and ultimately the newly opened Antones widely known as Austins home of the blues. In late 1976, Vaughan recorded a single with them Other Days as the Aside and Texas Clover as the Bside. Playing guitar on both tracks the single was released on February 7, 1977. In March readers of the Austin Sun voted them as Band of the Year. In addition to playing with the Cobras Vaughan jammed with many of his influences at Antones including Buddy Guy Hubert Sumlin Jimmy Rogers Lightnin Hopkins and Albert KingVaughan toured with the Cobras during much of 1977, but near the end of September when they decided to strive for a mainstream musical direction he left the band and formed Triple Threat Revue which included singer Lou Ann Barton bassist W. C. Clark and drummer Fredde Pharaoh Walden. In January 1978, they recorded four songs in Austin including Vaughans composition Im Cryin. The thirtyminute audio recording marks the only known studio recording of the band.\n\nDouble Trouble\nIn midMay 1978, Clark left to form his own group and Vaughan renamed the band Double Trouble taken from the title of an Otis Rush song. Following the recruitment of bassist Jackie Newhouse Walden quit in July and was briefly replaced by Jack Moore who had moved to Texas from Boston he performed with the band for about two months. Vaughan then began looking for a drummer and soon after he met Chris Layton through Sublett who was his roommate. Layton who had recently parted ways with Greezy Wheels was taught by Vaughan to play a shuffle rhythm. When Vaughan offered Layton the position he agreed. In early July Vaughan befriended Lenora Bailey known as Lenny who became his girlfriend and ultimately his wife. The marriage was to last for six and a half yearsIn early October 1978, Vaughan and Double Trouble earned a frequent residency performing at one of Austins most popular nightspots the Rome Inn. During a performance Edi Johnson an accountant at Manor Downs noticed Vaughan. She remembered Im not an authority on musicits whatever turned me onbut this did. She recommended him to Manor Downs owner Frances Carr and general manager Chesley Millikin who was interested in managing artists and saw Vaughans musical potential. After Barton quit Double Trouble in midNovember 1979, Millikin signed Vaughan to a management contract. Vaughan also hired Robert Cutter Brandenburg as road manager whom he had met in 1969. Addressing him as Stevie Ray Brandenburg convinced Vaughan to use his middle name on stageIn October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon attended a Double Trouble performance at Rockefellers in Houston. Shannon who was playing with Alan Haynes at the time participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented I went down there that night and Ill never forget this it was like when I walked in the door and I heard them playing it was like a revelation. Thats where I want to be thats where I belong right there. During the break I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didnt try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player Jackie NewhouseI didnt know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great. Almost three months later when Vaughan offered Shannon the position he readily accepted.\n\nDrug charge and trial\nOn December 5, 1979, while Vaughan was in a dressing room before a performance in Houston an offduty police officer arrested him after witnessing him using cocaine near an open window. He was formally charged with cocaine possession and subsequently released on 1,000 bail. Double Trouble was the opening act for Muddy Waters who said about Vaughans drug abuse Stevie could perhaps be the greatest guitar player that ever lived but he wont live to get 40 years old if he doesnt leave that white powder alone. The following year he was required to return on January 16 and February 29 for court appearancesDuring the final court date on April 17, 1980, Vaughan was sentenced with two years probation and was prohibited from leaving Texas. Along with a stipulation of entering treatment for drug abuse he was required to avoid persons or places of known disreputable or harmful character he refused to comply with both of these orders. After a lawyer was hired his probation officer had the sentence revised to allow him to work outside the state. The incident later caused him to refuse maid service while staying in hotels during concert tours.\n\nMontreux Jazz Festival\nAlthough popular in Texas at the time Double Trouble failed to gain national attention. The groups visibility improved when record producer Jerry Wexler recommended them to Claude Nobs organizer of the Montreux Jazz Festival. He insisted the festivals blues night would be great with Vaughan whom he called a jewel one of those rarities who comes along once in a lifetime and Nobs agreed to book Double Trouble on July 17, 1982Vaughan opened with a medley arrangement of Freddie Kings song Hide Away and his own fast instrumental composition Rude Mood. Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of Larry Davis Texas Flood Hound Dog Taylors Give Me Back My Wig and Albert Collins Collins Shuffle as well as three original compositions Pride and Joy Love Struck Baby and Dirty Pool. The set ended with boos from the audience. Peoples James McBride wrote\n\nHe seemed to come out of nowhere a Zorrotype figure in a riverboat gamblers hat roaring into the 82 Montreux festival with a 59 Stratocaster at his hip and two flamethrowing sidekicks he called Double Trouble. He had no album no record contract no name but he reduced the stage to a pile of smoking cinders and afterward everyone wanted to know who he was.\nAccording to road manager Don Opperman the way I remember it the ooos and the boos were mixed together but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie had just handed me his guitar and walked off stage and Im like are you coming back? There was a doorway back there the audience couldnt see the guys but I could. He went back to the dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally and that was the end of the show. According to Vaughan it wasnt the whole crowd that booed. It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo wow it sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud but shoot I had four army blankets folded over my amp and the volume level was on 2. Im used to playin on 10! The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004On the following night Double Trouble was booked in the lounge of the Montreux Casino with Jackson Browne in attendance. Browne jammed with Double Trouble until the early morning hours and offered them free use of his personal recording studio in downtown Los Angeles. In late November the band accepted his offer and recorded ten songs in two days. While they were in the studio Vaughan received a telephone call from David Bowie who had met him after the Montreux performance and he invited him to participate in a recording session for his next studio album Lets Dance. In January 1983, Vaughan recorded guitar on six of the albums eight songs including the title track and China Girl. The album was released on April 14, 1983, and sold over three times as many copies as Bowies previous album.\n\nNational success\nIn midMarch 1983, Gregg Geller vice president of AR at Epic Records signed Double Trouble to the label at the recommendation of record producer John Hammond. Soon afterward Epic financed a music video for Love Struck Baby which was filmed at the Cherry Tavern in New York City. Vaughan recalled we changed the name of the place in the video. Four years ago I got married in a club where we used to play all the time called the Rome Inn. When they closed it down the owner gave me the sign so in the video we put that up behind me on the stage.With the success of Lets Dance Bowie requested Vaughan as the featured instrumentalist for the upcoming Serious Moonlight Tour realizing that he was an essential aspect of the albums groundbreaking success. In late April Vaughan began rehearsals for the tour in Las Colinas Texas. When contract renegotiations for his performance fee failed Vaughan abandoned the tour days before its opening date and he was replaced by Earl Slick. Vaughan commented I couldnt gear everything on something I didnt really care a whole lot about. It was kind of risky but I really didnt need all the headaches. Although contributing factors were widely disputed Vaughan soon gained major publicity for quitting the tourOn May 9, the band performed at The Bottom Line in New York City where they opened for Bryan Adams with Hammond Mick Jagger John McEnroe Rick Nielsen Billy Gibbons and Johnny Winter in attendance. Brandenburg described the performance as ungodly I think Stevie played every lick as loud and as hard and with as much intensity as Ive ever heard him. The performance earned Vaughan a positive review published in the New York Post asserting that Double Trouble outperformed Adams. Fortunately Bryan Adams the Canadian rocker who is opening arena dates for Journey doesnt headline too often wrote Martin Porter who claimed that after the bands performance the stage had been rendered to cinders by the most explosively original showmanship to grace the New York stage in some time.\n\nTexas Flood\nAfter acquiring the recordings from Brownes studio Double Trouble began assembling the material for a fulllength LP. The album Texas Flood opens with the track Love Struck Baby which was written for Lenny on their lovestruck day. He composed Pride and Joy and Im Cryin for one of his former girlfriends Lindi Bethel. Although both are musically similar their lyrics are two different perspectives of the relationship. Along with covers of Howlin Wolf the Isley Brothers and Buddy Guy the album included Vaughans cover of Larry Davis Texas Flood a song that he became strongly associated with. Lenny served as a tribute to his wife which he composed at the end of their bedTexas Flood featured cover art by illustrator Brad Holland who is known for his artwork for Playboy and The New York Times. Originally envisioned with Vaughan sitting on a horse depicting a promotable resemblance Holland painted an image of him leaning against a wall with a guitar using a photograph as a reference. Released on June 13, 1983, Texas Flood peaked at number 38 and ultimately sold half a million copies. While Rolling Stone editor Kurt Loder asserted that Vaughan did not possess a distinctive voice according to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine the release was a monumental impact. Billboard described it as a guitar boogie lovers delight. Agent Alex Hodges commented No one knew how big that record would be because guitar players werent necessarily in vogue except for some that were so established they were undeniable ... he was one of the few artists that was recouped on every record in a short period of time.On June 16, Vaughan gave a performance at Tango nightclub in Dallas which celebrated the albums release. Assorted VIPs attended the performance including Ted Nugent Sammy Hagar and members of The Kinks and Uriah Heep. Jack Chase vice president of marketing for Epic recalled the comingout party at Tango was very important it was absolutely huge. All the radio station personalities DJs program directors all the retail record store owners and the important managers press all the executives from New York came downabout seven hundred people. We attacked in Dallas first with Q102-FM and DJ Redbeard. We had the Tango partyit was hot. It was the ticket. The Dallas Morning News reviewed the performance starting with the rhetorical question what if Stevie Ray Vaughan had an album release party and everybody came? It happened Thursday night at Tango. ... The adrenaline must have been gushing through the musicians veins as they performed with rare finesse and skill.Following a brief tour in Europe Hodges arranged an engagement for Double Trouble as The Moody Blues opening act during a twomonth tour of North America. Hodges stated that many people disliked the idea of Double Trouble opening for The Moody Blues but asserted that a common thread that both bands shared was albumoriented rock. Tommy Shannon described the tour as glorious Our record hadnt become that successful yet but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people. We just went out and played and it fit like a glove. The sound rang through those big coliseums like a monster. People were going crazy and they had no idea who we were! After appearing on the television series Austin City Limits the band played a soldout concert at New York Citys Beacon Theatre. Variety wrote that their ninetyminute set at the Beacon left no doubt that this young Texas musician is indeed the guitar hero of the present era.\n\nCouldnt Stand the Weather\nIn January 1984, Double Trouble began recording their second studio album Couldnt Stand the Weather at the Power Station with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond he was kind of like a nice hand on your shoulder as opposed to someone that jumped in and said lets redo this lets do that more. He didnt get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person. As the sessions began Vaughans cover of Bob Geddins Tin Pan Alley was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance ... we did probably the quietest version we ever did up til that point. We ended it and Hammond said thats the best that song will ever sound and we went we havent even got sounds have we? He goes that doesnt matter. Thats the best youll ever do that song. We tried it again five six seven times  I cant even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time.During recording sessions Vaughan began experimenting with other combinations of musicians including Fran Christina and Stan Harrison who played drums and saxophone respectively on the jazz instrumental Stangs Swang. Jimmie Vaughan played rhythm guitar on his cover of Guitar Slims The Things That I Used to Do and the title track in the latter of which Vaughan carries a worldly message in his lyrics. According to musicologist Andy Aledort Vaughans guitar playing throughout the song is marked by steady rhythmic strumming patterns and improvised lead lines with a distinctive RB and soul singlenote riff doubled in octaves by guitar and bassCouldnt Stand the Weather was released on May 15, 1984, and two weeks later it had rapidly outpaced the sales of Texas Flood. It peaked at number 31 and spent 38 weeks on the charts. The album includes Vaughans cover of Jimi Hendrixs song Voodoo Child Slight Return which provoked inevitable comparisons to Hendrix. According to AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine Couldnt Stand the Weather confirmed that the acclaimed debut was no fluke while matching if not bettering the sales of its predecessor thereby cementing Vaughans status as a giant of modern blues. According to authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford the album was a major turning point in Stevie Ray Vaughans development and Vaughans singing improved.\n\nCarnegie Hall\nOn October 4, 1984, Vaughan headlined a performance at Carnegie Hall that included many guest musicians. For the second half of the concert he added Jimmie as rhythm guitarist drummer George Rains keyboardist Dr. John Roomful of Blues horn section and featured vocalist Angela Strehli. The ensemble rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance and despite the solid dynamics of Double Trouble for the first half of the performance according to Patoski and Crawford the big band concept never entirely took form. Before arriving at the engagement the venue sold out which made Vaughan overexcited and nervous he did not calm down until halfway through the third song. The benefit for the TJ. Martell Foundations work in leukemia and cancer research was an important draw for the event. As his scheduled time slot drew closer he indicated that he preferred traveling to the venue by limousine to avoid being swarmed by fans on the street the band took the stage around 8:00 pm. The audience of 2,200 people which included Vaughans wife family and friends transformed the venue into what Stephen Holden of The New York Times described as a whistling stomping roadhouse.Introduced by Hammond as one of the greatest guitar players of all time Vaughan opened with Scuttle Buttin wearing a custommade mariachi suit he described as a Mexican tuxedo. Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of the Isley Brothers Testify The Jimi Hendrix Experiences Voodoo Child Slight Return Tin Pan Alley Elmore James The Sky Is Crying and W. C. Clarks Cold Shot along with four original compositions including Love Struck Baby Honey Bee Couldnt Stand the Weather and Rude Mood. During the second half of the performance Vaughan performed covers by Larry Davis Buddy Guy Guitar Slim Albert King Jackie Wilson and Albert Collins. The set ended with Vaughan performing solo renditions of Lenny and Rude Mood.The Dallas TimesHerald wrote that the performance was full of stomping feet and swaying bodies kids in blue jeans hanging off the balconies dancing bodies that clogged the aisles. The New York Times asserted that despite the venues muddy acoustics the bands performance was filled with verve and Vaughans playing was handsomely displayed. Jimmie Vaughan later commented I was worried the crowd might be a little stiff. Turned out theyre just like any other beer joint. Vaughan commented We wont be limited to just the trio although that doesnt mean well stop doing the trio. Im planning on doing that too. I aint gonna stay in one place. If I do Im stupid. The performance was recorded and in 1997 Epic Records released Live at Carnegie Hall which was ultimately certified goldAfter the concert Vaughan attended a private party at a downtown club in New York which was sponsored by MTV where he was greeted by an hours worth of supporters. On the following day Double Trouble made an appearance at a record store in Greenwich Village where they signed autographs for fansIn late October 1984, the band toured Australia and New Zealand which included one of their first appearances on Australian televisionon Hey Hey Its Saturdaywhere they performed Texas Flood and an interview on Sounds. On November 5 and 9, they played soldout concerts at the Sydney Opera House. After returning to the US Double Trouble went on a brief tour in California. Soon afterward Vaughan and Lenny went to the island of Saint Croix part of the US. Virgin Islands where they had spent some time vacationing in December. The next month Double Trouble flew to Japan where they appeared for five performances including at K\u014dsei Nenkin Kaikan in Osaka.\n\nSoul to Soul\nIn March 1985, recording for Double Troubles third studio album Soul to Soul began at the Dallas Sound Lab. As the sessions progressed Vaughan became increasingly frustrated with his own lack of inspiration. He was also allowed a relaxed pace of recording the album which contributed to a lack of focus due to excesses in alcohol and other drugs. Roadie Byron Barr later recalled the routine was to go to the studio do dope and play pingpong. Vaughan who found it increasingly difficult to be able to play rhythm guitar parts and sing at the same time wanted to add another dimension to the band so he hired keyboardist Reese Wynans to record on the album he joined the band soon thereafterDuring the albums production Vaughan appeared at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the US. national anthem The StarSpangled Banner his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage Vaughan acquired an autograph from former player for the New York Yankees Mickey Mantle. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press As Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate he was only lucid enough to know that he wanted Mickey Mantles autograph. Mantle obliged. I never signed a guitar before. Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure hed be dead before he hit 30. Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrixs rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison I heard they even wrote about it in one of the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. I hate that stuff. His version was great.Released on September 30, 1985, Soul to Soul peaked at number 34 and remained on the Billboard 200 through mid1986, eventually certified gold. Critic Jimmy Guterman of Rolling Stone wrote theres some life left in their blues rock pastiche its also possible that theyve run out of gas. According to Patoski and Crawford sales of the album did not match Couldnt Stand the Weather suggesting Stevie Ray and Double Trouble were plateauing. Vaughan commented as far as whats on there songwise I like the album a lot. It meant a lot to us what we went through to get this record. There were a lot of odds and we still stayed strong. We grew a lot with the people in the band and immediate friends around us we learned a lot and grew a lot closer. That has a lot to do with why its called Soul to Soul.\n\nLive Alive\nAfter touring for nine and a half months Epic requested a fourth album from Double Trouble as part of their contractual obligation. In July 1986, Vaughan decided that they would record the LP Live Alive during three live appearances in Austin and Dallas. On July 17 and 18, the band performed soldout concerts at the Austin Opera House and July 19 at the Dallas Starfest. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP which was produced by Vaughan. Shannon was backstage before the Austin concert and predicted to new manager Alex Hodges that both Vaughan and he were headed for a brick wall. Guitarist Denny Freeman attended the Austin performances he called the shows a musical mess because they would go into these chaotic jams with no control. I didnt know what exactly was going on but I was concerned. Both Layton and Shannon remarked that their work schedule and drugs were causing the band to lose focus. According to Wynans Things were getting illogical and crazy.The Live Alive album was released on November 17, 1986, and was the only official live Double Trouble LP made commercially available during Vaughans lifetime though it never appeared on the Billboard 200 chart. Though many critics claimed that most of the album was overdubbed engineer Gary Olazabal who mixed the album asserted that most of the material was recorded poorly. Vaughan later admitted that it was not one of his better efforts he recalled I wasnt in very good shape when we recorded Live Alive. At the time I didnt realize how bad a shape I was in. There were more fixit jobs done on the album than I would have liked. Some of the work sounds like it was the work of halfdead people. There were some great notes that came out but I just wasnt in control nobody was.\n\nDrugs and alcohol\nIn 1960 when Vaughan was six years old he began stealing his fathers drinks. Drawn in by its effects he started making his own drinks and this resulted in alcohol dependence. He explained thats when I first started stealing daddys drinks. Or when my parents were gone Id find the bottle and make myself one. I thought it was cool ... thought the kids down the street would think it was cool. Thats where it began and I had been depending on it ever since. According to the authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford In the ensuing twentyfive years he had worked his way through the Physicians Desk Reference before finding his poisons of preferencealcohol and cocaine.\n\nWhile Vaughan asserted that he first experienced the effects of cocaine when a doctor prescribed him a liquid solution containing it as a nasal spray according to Patoski and Crawford the earliest that Vaughan is known to have used it is in 1975, while performing with the Cobras. Before that Vaughan had briefly used other drugs such as cannabis methamphetamine and Quaaludes the brand name for methaqualone. After 1975, he regularly drank whiskey and used cocaine particularly mixing the two substances together. According to Hopkins by the time of Double Troubles European tour in September 1986, his lifestyle of substance abuse had reached a peak probably better characterized as the bottom of a deep chasm.At the height of Vaughans substance abuse he drank 1 US quart 095 L of whiskey and used onequarter of an ounce 7 g of cocaine each day. Personal assistant Tim Duckworth explained I would make sure he would eat breakfast instead of waking up drinking every morning which was probably the worst thing he was doing. According to Vaughan it got to the point where if Id try to say hi to somebody I would just fall apart crying. It was like solid doom.In September 1986, Double Trouble traveled to Denmark for a onemonth tour of Europe. During the late night hours of September 28, Vaughan became ill after a performance in Ludwigshafen Germany suffering from neardeath dehydration for which he received medical treatment. The incident resulted in his checking into The London Clinic under the care of Dr. Victor Bloom who warned him that he was a month away from death. After staying in London for more than a week he returned to the United States and entered Peachford Hospital in Atlanta where he spent four weeks in rehabilitation and then checked into rehab in Austin.\n\nLive Alive tour\nIn November 1986, following his departure from rehab Vaughan moved back into his mothers Glenfield Avenue house in Dallas which is where he had spent much of his childhood. During this time Double Trouble began rehearsals for the Live Alive tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled Stevie was real worried about playing after hed gotten sober..he didnt know if he had anything left to offer. Once we got back out on the road he was very inspired and motivated. The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University which was Vaughans first performance with Double Trouble after rehab. On December 31, 1986, they played a concert at Atlantas Fox Theatre which featured encore performances with Lonnie MackAs the tour progressed Vaughan was longing to work on material for his next LP but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny which restricted him from any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years but Double Trouble wrote the song Crossfire with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled we wrote the music and they had to write the lyrics. We had just gotten together Stevie was unable to be there at that time. He was in Dallas doing some things and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote. On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a monthlong tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Torontos Maple Leaf Gardens the band was booked for a European leg which included 22 performances and ended in Oulu Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughans last concert appearance in Europe.\n\nIn Step\nAfter Vaughans divorce from Lenora Lenny Darlene Bailey became final recording for Double Troubles fourth and final studio album In Step began at Kiva Studios in Memphis Tennessee working with producer Jim Gaines and cosongwriter Doyle Bramhall. Initially he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled In Step was for him a big growing experience. In my opinion its our best studio album and I think he felt that way too. Bramhall who had also entered rehab wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption. According to Vaughan the album was titled In Step because Im finally in step with life in step with myself in step with my music. The albums liner notes include the quote thank God the elevators broken a reference to the twelvestep program proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous AA.After the In Step recording sessions moved to Los Angeles Vaughan added horn players Joe Sublett and Darrell Leonard who played saxophone and trumpet respectively on both Crossfire and Love Me Darlin. Shortly before the albums production was complete Vaughan and Double Trouble appeared at a presidential inaugural party in Washington DC. for George H. W. Bush. In Step was released on June 13, 1989, and eight months later it was certified gold. The album was Vaughans most commercially successful release and his first one to win a Grammy Award. It peaked at number 33 on the Billboard 200, spending 47 weeks on the chart. In Step included the song Crossfire which was written by Double Trouble Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth it became his only number one hit. The album also included one of his first recordings to feature the use of a Fuzz Face on Vaughans cover of the Howlin Wolf song Love Me Darlin.In July 1989, Neil Perry a writer for Sounds magazine wrote the album closes with the browsoothing swoon of Riviera Paradise a slow lengthy guitar and piano workout that proves just why Vaughan is to the guitar what Nureyev is to ballet. According to music journalist Robert Christgau Vaughan was writing blues for AA..he escapes the blues undamaged for the first time in his career. In October 1989, the Boca Raton News described Vaughans guitar solos as determined clearheaded and downright stinging and his lyrics as tensionfilled allegories.\n\nDeath\nOn Monday August 27, 1990, at 12:50 am. CDT Vaughan and members of Eric Claptons touring entourage played an allstar encore jam session at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Alpine Valley Resort in East Troy Wisconsin. They then left for Midway International Airport in Chicago in a Bell 206B helicopter the most common way for acts to enter and exit the venue as there is only one road in and out heavily used by fans. The helicopter crashed into a nearby ski hill shortly after takeoff. Vaughan and the four others on boardpilot Jeff Brown agent Bobby Brooks bodyguard Nigel Browne and tour manager Colin Smythedied. The helicopter was owned by Chicagobased company Omniflight Helicopters. The Elkhorn coroners inquest found that all five men died instantlyThe investigation determined the aircraft departed in foggy conditions with visibility reportedly under 2 mi 32 km according to a local forecast. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated As the third helicopter was departing it remained at a lower altitude than the others and the pilot turned southeasterly toward rising terrain. Subsequently the helicopter crashed on hilly terrain about threefifths of a mile from the takeoff point. Federal Aviation Administration FAA records showed that Brown was qualified to fly by instruments in a fixedwing aircraft but not in a helicopter. Toxicology tests performed on the victims revealed no traces of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Vaughans funeral service was held on August 31, 1990, at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas Texas. His wooden casket quickly became adorned with bouquets of flowers. An estimated 3,000 mourners joined a procession led by a white hearse. Among those at the public ceremony were Jeff Healey Charlie Sexton ZZ Top Colin James Stevie Wonder Bonnie Raitt and Buddy Guy. Vaughans grave marker reads Thank you ... for all the love you passed our way.\n\nMusical style\nVaughans music was rooted in blues rock and jazz. He was influenced by Johnny Winter Jimi Hendrix Albert King Lonnie Mack BB. King Freddie King Albert Collins Johnny Guitar Watson Buddy Guy Howlin Wolf Otis Rush Guitar Slim Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. According to nightclub owner Clifford Antone who opened Antones in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antones in July 1977 and it almost scared him to death saying it was the best Ive ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie. While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan Jimi Hendrix was Vaughans greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitaristhe played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact Im not sure if he even played the guitarhe played music. He was also influenced by such jazz guitarists as Django Reinhardt Wes Montgomery Kenny Burrell and George BensonIn 1987, Vaughan listed Lonnie Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to both as a youngster and as an adult. Vaughan observed that Mack was ahead of his time and said I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie. On another occasion Vaughan said that he had learned tremolo picking and vibrato from Mack and that Mack had taught him to play guitar from the heart. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978:\n\nWe was in Texas looking for pickers and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying Man you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your songs. He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be when I walked in the door he was playing Wham! And I said Dadgum. He was playing it right. Id been playing it wrong for a long time and needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in 78, I believe.\nVaughans relationship with another Texas blues legend Johnny Winter was a little more complex. Although they met several times and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material as in the case of Boot Hill Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography Raisin Cain Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. We even played together over at Tommy Shannons house one time. Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a blues festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill explaining that he has been misquoted and that Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him. Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that mines a little bit rawer I think.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nVaughan owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. His guitar of choice and the instrument that he became most associated with was the Fender Stratocaster his favorite being a 1963 body with a 1962 neck and pickups dated from 1959. This is why Vaughan usually referred to his Stratocaster as a 1959 Strat. He explained why he favored this guitar in a 1983 interview I like the strength of its sound. Any guitar I play has got to be pretty versatile. Its got a big strong tone and itll take anything I do to it. Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his first wife or Number One. Another favorite guitar was a slightly later Strat he named Lenny after his wife Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar a 1965 Stratocaster that had been refinished in red with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking 300 for it which was way more than Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar so she got six of their friends to chip in 50 each and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night after bringing Lenny the guitar and wife home with him he wrote the song Lenny. He had started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings although he did play other guitars including custom guitars.\nOne of the custom guitarsnicknamed Mainwas built by James Hamilton of Hamiltone Guitars in Buffalo New York. It was a gift from Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. Gibbons had commissioned Hamilton to build the guitar in 1979. There were some delays including having to redo the mother of pearl inlay of Vaughans name on the fretboard when he changed his stage name from Stevie Vaughan to Stevie Ray Vaughan. The guitar was presented to him by Jim Hamilton on April 29, 1984. Hamilton recalls that Stevie Ray Vaughan was so happy with the guitar that he played it that night at Springfest on the University of Buffalo campus. It remained one of the main guitars he used on stage and in studio. Vaughan made some alterations to the guitar including replacing the bronze color Gibson knobs with white Fender knobs as he preferred the ribbing on the Fender knobs. The pickups had to be changed after the guitar was used in the Couldnt Stand the Weather video in which Stevie and Main were drenched with water and the pickups were ruined. Vaughans preferred guitar has been summarized as his\n\nNumber One Strat which Stevie claimed to be a 59, since that was the date stamped on the back of the pickups this was incorrect however as guitar tech Rene Martinez who oversaw SRVs guitars since 1980) found the stamp of 1963 on the body and 1962 on the original neck the neck was replaced in 1989 after it could no longer be refretted properly Rene used the neck from another SRV favorite Red as it was also a 1962 model. The pickups are also relatively low output not the hot overwound myth that gained legs during the 80s all 3 pickups are rumored to be under 6k ohms output impedance which would be typical of a 1959 set the neck pickups tended to be hottest but not by much. Although the Fender SRV signature model uses Texas Special pickups which Stevie was heavily involved in the making of they do not accurately represent the sound of his original Number One.\nVaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Stratstyle guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a halfstep below standard tuning. With these heavy string sizes it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail because of his quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue which he used to keep a fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez who was Stevies guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile thicker at the top which was more comfortable for his thumbover style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements Vaughan often had his roadie Byron Barr obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barrs father. As for his usage of plectrums Vaughan preferred Fender medium gauge guitar picks using one of the rounder shoulders of the pick rather than the pointed tip to pluck and strum the strings.\nVaughan was also photographed playing a Rickenbacker Capri a National Duolian Epiphone Riviera Gibson Flying V as well as several other models. Vaughan used a Gibson Johnny Smith to record Stangs Swang and a Guild 12-string acoustic for his performance on MTV Unplugged in January 1990. On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughans Stratocasters the aforementioned Lenny strat was sold at an auction to benefit Eric Claptons Crossroads Centre in Antigua the instrument was bought by Guitar Center for 623,500.\n\nAmplifiers and effects\nVaughan was a catalyst in the revival of vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two blackface Fender Super Reverbs which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs including blackface Fender Vibroverbs and brands including Dumble and Marshall which he used for his clean soundWhile an Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Vox wahwah pedal were his mainstay effects Vaughan experimented with a range of effects. He used a Fender Vibratone designed as a Leslie speaker for electric guitars which provided a warbling chorus effect it can be heard on the track Cold Shot. He used a vintage Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face that can be heard on In Step as well as an Octavia. The Guitar Geek website provides a detailed illustration of Vaughans 1985 equipment set up based on interviews with his guitar tech and effects builder Cesar Diaz.\n\nLegacy\nVaughan throughout his career revived blues rock and paved the way for many other artists. Vaughans work continues to influence numerous blues rock and alternative artists including John Mayer Kenny Wayne Shepherd Mike McCready Albert Cummings Los Lonely Boys and Chris Duarte among others. AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Vaughan as the leading light in American blues who developed a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist regardless of genre. In 1983, Variety magazine called Vaughan the guitar hero of the present era.In the months that followed his death Vaughan sold over 55 million albums in the United States. On September 25, 1990, Epic released Family Style an LP the Vaughan brothers cut at Ardent Studios in Memphis Tennessee. The label released several promotional singles and videos for the collaborative effort. In November 1990, CMV Enterprises released Pride and Joy a collection of eight Double Trouble music videos. Sony signed a deal with the Vaughan estate to obtain control of his back catalog as well as permission to release albums with previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. On October 29, 1991, The Sky Is Crying was released as Vaughans first posthumous album with Double Trouble and featured studio recordings from 1984 to 1985. Other compilations live albums and films have also been released since his death.\nOn October 3, 1991, Texas governor Ann Richards proclaimed Stevie Ray Vaughan Commemoration Day during which a memorial concert was held at the Texas Theatre. In 1993, a memorial statue of Vaughan was unveiled on Auditorium Shores and is the first public monument of a musician in Austin. In September 1994, a Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Run for Recovery was held in Dallas the event was a benefit for the Ethel Daniels Foundation established to help those in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction who cannot afford treatment. In 1999, the Musicians Assistance Program later renamed MusiCares MAP Fund created the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award to honor the memory of Vaughan and to recognize musicians for their devotion to helping other addicts struggling with the recovery process. The recipients include Eric Clapton David Crosby Steven Tyler Alice Cooper Ozzy Osbourne Pete Townshend Chris Cornell Jerry Cantrell and Mike McCready among others. In 1993, Martha Vaughan established the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Scholarship Fund awarded to students at WE. Greiner Middle School in Oakcliff who intend to attend college and pursue the arts as a profession.\n\nAwards and honors\nVaughan won five W. C. Handy Awards and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000. In 1985, he was named an honorary admiral in the Texas Navy. Vaughan had a single numberone hit on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for the song Crossfire. His album sales in the US. stand at over 15 million units. Family Style released shortly after his death won the 1991 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album and became his bestselling nonDouble Trouble studio album with over a million shipments in the US. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked him seventh among the 100 Greatest Guitar Players of All Time with a 2023 update placing him 20th. He also became eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, but did not appear on a nominations roster until 2014. He was inducted in the RRHOF alongside Double Trouble in 2015. Guitar World magazine ranked him as Number One in its list of the greatest blues guitaristsIn 1994 the city of Austin Texas erected the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial on the hiking trail beside Lady Bird Lake.\n\nDiscography\nTexas Flood 1983)\nCouldnt Stand the Weather 1984)\nSoul to Soul 1985)\nIn Step 1989)\nFamily Style 1990)\nThe Sky Is Crying 1991)\n\nSee also\n1980s in music\nList of blues rock musicians\nList of electric blues musicians\nList of guitarists\nList of Texas blues musicians\nMusic of Austin Texas\nMusic of Texas\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nDickerson James 2004).

He was given the nickname Slash by actor Seymour Cassel because he was always in a hurry zipping around from one thing to another.\n\nIn 1979, Slash decided to form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized but it prompted Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist Slash decided to learn how to play bass. During his first lesson Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after meeting Robert Wolin a teacher at Fairfax Music School and hearing him play Brown Sugar by the Rolling Stones and a Cream song. As a result Slash stated When I heard him do that I said Thats what I want to do. Equipped with a onestring flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother he began taking classes with Wolin.

He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers including onetime Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes and worked on material that included the main riff of what became the Guns N Roses song Rocket Queen. Slash disbanded the group the following year due to them not being able to find a singer as well as Adlers lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan. He along with Adler then joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Following his time with Hollywood Rose Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and unsuccessfully auditioned for Poison a glam metal band that he later openly derided.\n\n1985\u20131996: first stint with Guns N Roses\nIn June 1985, Slash was asked by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join their new band Guns N Roses along with Duff McKagan and Steven Adler replacing founding members Tracii Guns Ole Beich and Rob Gardner respectively. They played Los Angelesarea nightclubssuch as the Whisky a Go Go The Roxy and The Troubadourand opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. Before one of the shows in 1985, Slash shoplifted a black felt top hat and a Native Americanstyle silver concho belt from two stores on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. He then combined the hat with parts of the belt to create a piece of custom headwear for the show. He said he felt really cool wearing the hat and it became his trademark. It was during 1985\u20131986 that the band wrote most of its classic material including Welcome to the Jungle Sweet Child o Mine and Paradise City. As a result of their rowdy and rebellious behavior Guns N Roses quickly received the moniker Most Dangerous Band in the World causing Slash to remark For some strange reason Guns N Roses is like the catalyst for controversy even before we had any kind of record deal. After being scouted by several major record labels the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986In July 1987, Guns N Roses released its debut album Appetite for Destruction which as of September 2008, had sold over 28 million copies worldwide 18 million of which were sold in the United States making it the bestselling debut album of all time in the US.

Like a Suicide. As their success grew so did interpersonal tensions within the band. In 1989, during a show as opening act for the Rolling Stones Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band did not stop dancing with Mr. Brownstone a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use.

In November of that year the band released The Spaghetti Incident? a cover album of mostly punk songs which proved less successful than its predecessors. Slash then wrote several songs for what would have become the followup album to the Use Your Illusion double album. Rose and Duff however rejected the materialWith the bands failure to collaborate resulting in no album being recorded Slash announced in October 1996 that he was no longer a part of Guns N Roses. Slash stated at the time Axl and I have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate but at this point Im no longer in the band. Paul Tobiass inclusion in the band was another factor in Slash leaving with Slash having both creative and personal differences with Tobias. However in his 2007 autobiography Slash stated that his decision to leave the band was not based on artistic differences with Rose but on Roses constant lateness to concerts the alleged legal manipulation Rose used since denied by Rose to gain control of the band and the departures of Adler and Stradlin.\n\n1994\u20132002: Slashs Snakepit\nIn 1994, Slash formed Slashs Snakepit a side project that featured his Guns N Roses bandmates Matt Sorum and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively as well as Alice in Chains Mike Inez on bass and Jellyfishs Eric Dover on vocals.

He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight under the tutelage of his father who was a mariachi musician. His younger brother Jorge also became a professional guitarist.\nThe family moved from Autl\u00e1n to Tijuana on the border with the United States. Carlos rock and roll career started in the city park Parque Teniente Guerrero his mother took him to see the Tjs the pioneer rock and roll band from the city. TJ tee jay is a nickname for Tijuana. They were formed by Javier B\u00e1tiz. At the age of 12 Carlos became a roadie and eventually he would join them as a bass player bass because B\u00e1tiz was playing guitar. He later left so he could play guitar in another bar band. The Tjs and B\u00e1tiz turned Carlos onto Blues. Specially into TBone Walker Muddy Waters BB. King Chuck Berry Howlin Wolf and James Brown.\nThe Santanas then moved to San Francisco where his father had steady work. In October 1966, Santana started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. Santana later said If I would go to some cats room hed be listening to Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix another guy to the Stones and the Beatles. Another guyd be listening to Tito Puente and Mongo Santamar\u00eda. Another guyd be listening to Miles Davis and John Coltrane.. to me it was like being at a university.Around the age of eight Santana fell under the influence of blues performers like BB. King Javier B\u00e1tiz Mike Bloomfield and John Lee Hooker. G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3s mid1960s jazz guitar work also strongly influenced Santanas playing. Indeed Szab\u00f3s composition Gypsy Queen was used as the second part of Santanas 1970 treatment of Peter Greens composition Black Magic Woman almost down to identical guitar licks. Santanas 2012 instrumental album Shape Shifter includes a song called Mr. Szabo played in tribute in the style of Szab\u00f3. Santana also credits Hendrix Bloomfield Hank Marvin and Peter Green as important influences he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a 2000 biography of Bloomfield Michael Bloomfield If You Love These Blues  An Oral History. Between the ages of 10 and 12, he was sexually abused by an American man who brought him across the border. Santana lived in the Mission District graduated from James Lick Middle School and left Mission High School in 1965. He was accepted at California State University Northridge and Humboldt State University but chose not to attend college.\n\nEarly career\nSantana was influenced by popular artists of the 1950s such as BB. King TBone Walker Javier Batiz and John Lee Hooker. Soon after he began playing guitar he joined local bands along the Tijuana Strip where he was able to begin developing his own sound. He was also introduced to a variety of new musical influences including jazz and folk music and witnessed the growing hippie movement centered in San Francisco in the 1960s. After several years spent working as a dishwasher at Tic Tock DriveIn No2 and busking to pay for a Gibson SG replacing a destroyed Gibson Melody Maker Santana decided to become a fulltime musician. In 1966, he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated Paul Butterfield set to play a Sunday matinee at Bill Grahams Fillmore Auditorium. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the Butterfield Blues Band Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. Santanas guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and GrahamDuring the same year he and fellow street musicians David Brown bass guitar Marcus Malone percussion and Gregg Rolie lead vocals Hammond Organ B3) formed the Santana Blues Band.\n\nRecord deal Woodstock breakthrough and height of success 1969\u20131972\nSantanas band was signed by Columbia Records which shortened its name to simply Santana. It went into the studio to record its first album in January 1969, finally laying down tracks in May that became its first album. Members were not satisfied with the release dismissed drummer Bob Livingston and added Mike Shrieve who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Then the band lost percussionist Marcus Malone who was charged with involuntary manslaughter. Michael Carabello was reenlisted in his place bringing with him experienced Nicaraguan percussionist Jos\u00e9 Chepito Areas.\nMajor rock music promoter Bill Graham a Latin Music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception arranged for the band to appear at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival highlighted by an elevenminute performance of a throbbing instrumental Soul Sacrifice. Its inclusion in the Woodstock film and soundtrack album vastly increased the bands popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the Willie Bobo song Evil Ways as he felt it would get radio airplay. The bands first album Santana was released in August 1969 and became a hit reaching No. 4 on the US. Billboard 200The bands performance at Woodstock and the followup sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim. The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group highlighting the different musical directions Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie along with some of the other band members wanted to emphasize a basic hard rock sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana however was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy ethereal elements in the music. He became fascinated with G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 Miles Davis Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane as well as developing a growing interest in spirituality. At the same time Chepito Areas was stricken with a nearfatal brain hemorrhage and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement first Willie Bobo then Coke Escovedo while others in the band especially Michael Carabello felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed and the band started to disintegrate.\nConsolidating the interest generated by their first album and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album Abraxas in September 1970. The albums mix of rock blues jazz salsa and other influences was very well received showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the bands early sound. Abraxas included two of Santanas most enduring and wellknown hits Oye Como Va and Black Magic WomanGypsy Queen. Abraxas spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970. The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4\u00d7 platinum in 1986. In 2003, the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 500 greatest albums of all timeTeenage San Francisco Bay Area guitar prodigy Neal Schon joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album Santana III. The band now boasted a powerful dualleadguitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the bands sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group Tower of Powers horn section Luis Gasca of Malo and other session musicians which added to both percussion and vocals injecting more energy to the proceedings. Santana III was another success reaching No. 1 on the album charts selling two million copies and yielding the hit No One to Depend On.\nTension between members of the band continued however. Along with musical differences drug use became a problem and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the bands performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the bands musical direction much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima Peru due to unruly fans and student protests against US. governmental policies.\nIn January 1972, Santana Schon Escovedo and Lewis joined former Band of Gypsys drummer Buddy Miles for a concert at Hawaiis Diamond Head Crater which was recorded for the album Carlos Santana  Buddy Miles! Live which became a gold record.\n\nCaravanserai\nIn early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album Caravanserai. During the studio sessions Santana and Michael Shrieve brought in other musicians percussionists James Mingo Lewis and LatinJazz veteran Armando Peraza replacing Michael Carabello and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing David Brown. Also assisting on keyboards were Wendy Haas and Tom Coster. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle later he and Schon became founding members of Journey.\nWhen Caravanserai did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards jazz fusion. The album received critical praise but CBS executive Clive Davis warned Santana and the band that it would sabotage the bands position as a Top 40\" act. Nevertheless over the years the album achieved platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in Ben FongTorres Rolling Stone 1972 cover story The Resurrection of Carlos Santana.\n\nShifting styles and spirituality 1972\u20131979\nIn 1972, Santana became interested in the pioneering fusion band the Mahavishnu Orchestra and its guitarist John McLaughlin. Aware of Santanas interest in meditation McLaughlin introduced Santana and his wife Deborah to his guru Sri Chinmoy. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name Devadip meaning The lamp light and eye of God. Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together Love Devotion Surrender 1973) with members of Santana and the Mahavishnu Orchestra along with percussionist Don Alias and organist Larry Young both of whom had made appearances along with McLaughlin on Miles Davis classic 1970 album Bitches Brew.\nIn 1973, Santana having obtained legal rights to the bands name Santana formed a new version of the band with Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion Doug Rauch on bass Michael Shrieve on drums and Tom Coster and Richard Kermode on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist Leon Thomas for the tour supporting Caravanserai in Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, which was recorded for the 1974 live sprawling highenergy triple vinyl LP fusion album Lotus. CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms and Lotus was available in the US. only as an expensive imported threerecord set. The group later went into the studio and recorded Welcome 1973) which further reflected Santanas interests in jazz fusion and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy.\nA collaboration with John Coltranes widow Alice Coltrane Illuminations 1974) followed. The album delved into avantgarde esoteric free jazz Eastern Indian and classical influences with other exMiles Davis sidemen Jack DeJohnette and Dave Holland. Soon after Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode Thomas and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist Leon Patillo later a successful Contemporary Christian artist and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album Borboletta which was released in 1974. Drummer Leon Ndugu Chancler later joined the band as a replacement for Michael Shrieve who left to pursue a solo career.\n\nBy this time Bill Grahams management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santanas move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting Santana back into the charts with the edgy streetwise ethnic sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the groups direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and jazz fusion circles sales had plummeted.\nSantana along with Tom Coster producer David Rubinson and Chancler formed yet another version of Santana adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album Amigos which featured the songs Dance Sister Dance and Let It Shine had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM albumoriented rock stations with the instrumental Europa Earths Cry Heavens Smile and reintroduced Santana to the charts. In 1976, Rolling Stone ran a second cover story on Santana entitled Santana Comes Home. In February 1976, Santana was presented with fifteen gold discs in Australia representing sales in excess of 244,000The albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the bands commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s Zombies hit Shes Not There on the 1977 double album Moonflower.\nSantana recorded two solo projects in this time Oneness Silver Dreams  Golden Reality in 1979 and The Swing of Delight in 1980, which featured Herbie Hancock Wayne Shorter Ron Carter and Tony Williams.\nThe pressures and temptations of being a highprofile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which guru Sri Chinmoy and his followers demanded were in conflict and imposed considerable stress upon Santanas lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the gurus visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.\n\n1980s and early 1990s\nMore radiofriendly singles followed from Santana and the band. Winning in 1981 from Zebop and Hold On a remake of the Canadian artist Ian Thomas song in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary RB producer Jerry Wexler. The 1983 album Havana Moon revisited Santanas early musical experiences in Tijuana with Bo Diddleys Who Do You Love and the title cut Chuck Berrys Havana Moon. The albums guests included Booker T. Jones the Fabulous Thunderbirds Willie Nelson and even Santanas fathers mariachi orchestra. Santana again paid tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to La Bamba which was based on the life of rock and roll legend Ritchie Valens and starred Lou Diamond Phillips.\nThe band Santana returned in 1985 with a new album Beyond Appearances and two years later with Freedom. Freedom is the fifteenth studio album by Santana. By this recording Santana had nine members some of whom had returned after being with the band in previous versions including lead singer on the album Buddy Miles. Freedom moved away from the more poppy sound of the previous album Beyond Appearances and back to the bands original Latin rock.\nGrowing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group Weather Report jazz pianist McCoy Tyner Blues legend John Lee Hooker Frank Franklin Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid and West African singer Salif Keita. He and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead later recorded and performed with Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji who conceived one of Santanas famous 1960s drum jams Jingo. In 1988, Santana organized a reunion with past members from the Santana band for a series of concert dates. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the bands accomplishments with Viva Santana! double CD compilation. That same year Santana formed an allinstrumental group featuring jazz legend Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included Patrice Rushen on keyboards Alphonso Johnson on bass Armando Peraza and Chepito Areas on percussion and Leon Ndugu Chancler on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press who compared the effort with the era of Caravanserai 1972). Santana released another solo record Blues for Salvador 1987) which won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\nIn 1990, Santana left Columbia Records after twentytwo years and signed with Polygram. The following year he made a guest appearance on Ottmar Lieberts album Solo Para Ti 1991) on the songs Reaching out 2 U and on a cover of his own song Samba Pa Ti. In 1992, Santana hired the jam band Phish as his opening act. On his 1992 tour Santana regularly invited some or all of the members of Phish to jam with his band during his headlining performances. Phish also toured with Santana in Europe in 1996.\n\nReturn to commercial success\nSantana kicked off the 1990s with a new album Spirits Dancing in the Flesh in 1990. This was followed by Milagro in 1992, a live album Sacred Fire in 1993 and Brothers a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez in 1994, but sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases and eventually he was even without a recording contract. However Arista Records Clive Davis who had worked with Santana at Columbia Records signed him and encouraged him to record a starstudded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999's Supernatural which included collaborations with Everlast Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty Eric Clapton Lauryn Hill Wyclef Jean CeeLo Green Man\u00e1 Dave Matthews KC Porter J. B. Eckl and others.\nHowever the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. Smooth a dynamic chacha stopstart number cowritten and sung by Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty is laced throughout with Santanas guitar fills and runs. The tracks energy was immediately apparent on radio and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. Smooth spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last No. 1 single of the 1990s. The music video set on a hot barrio street was also very popular. Supernatural reached number one on the US album charts and the followup single Maria Maria featuring the RB duo the Product GB also hit number one spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. Supernatural eventually shipped over 15 million copies in the United States and won 8 Grammy Awards including Album of the Year making it Santanas most successful album.\nCarlos Santana alongside the classic Santana lineup of their first two albums was inducted as an individual into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

His songwriting partnership with the bands lead vocalist Mick Jagger is one of the most successful in history. His career spans over six decades and his guitar playing style has been a trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the bands career. Richards gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use and he was often portrayed as a countercultural figure. First professionally known as Keith Richard by the early 1970s he had fully asserted his family name.\nRichards was born in and grew up in Dartford Kent. He studied at the Dartford Technical School and Sidcup Art College. After graduating Richards befriended Jagger Bill Wyman Charlie Watts Ian Stewart and Brian Jones and joined the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones Richards also sings lead on some Stones songs. Richards typically sings lead on at least one song a concert including Happy Before They Make Me Run and Connection. Outside of his career with the Rolling Stones Richards has also played with his own sideproject The XPensive Winos. He also appeared in three Pirates of the Caribbean films as Captain Teague father of Jack Sparrow whose look and characterisation was inspired by Richards himself.\nIn 1989, Richards was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004 into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him fourth on its list of 100 best guitarists in 2011. In 2023, Rolling Stones ranking was 15th. The magazine lists fourteen songs that Richards wrote with Jagger on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.\n\nEarly life\nRichards was born on 18 December 1943 at Livingston Hospital in Dartford Kent England. He is the only child of Doris Maud Lydia n\u00e9e Dupree and Herbert William Richards. His father was a factory worker who was wounded in the Second World War during the Normandy invasion. Richardss paternal grandparents Ernie and Eliza Richards were socialists and civic leaders whom he credited as more or less creating the Walthamstow Labour Party and both were mayors of the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow in Essex with Eliza becoming mayor in 1941. His greatgrandfathers family originated from WalesHis maternal grandfather Augustus Theodore Gus Dupree who toured Britain with a jazz big band Gus Dupree and His Boys fostered Richardss interest in the guitar. Richards has said that it was Dupree who gave him his first guitar. His grandfather teased the young Richards with a guitar that was on a shelf that Richards couldnt reach at the time. Finally Dupree told Richards that if Richards could reach the guitar he could have it. Richards then devised all manner of ways of reaching the guitar including putting books and cushions on a chair until finally getting hold of the instrument after which his grandfather taught him the rudiments of Richardss first tune Malague\u00f1a. He worked on the number like mad and then his grandfather let him keep the guitar which he called the prize of the century. Richards played at home listening to recordings by Billie Holiday Louis Armstrong Duke Ellington and others. His father on the other hand disparaged his sons musical enthusiasm. One of Richardss first guitar heroes was Elviss guitarist Scotty Moore.\nRichards attended Wentworth Primary School with Mick Jagger and was his neighbour until 1954 when the Richards and Jagger families both moved. From 1955 to 1959, Richards attended Dartford Technical High School for Boys. He never sat the elevenplus due to illness. Recruited by Dartford Techs choirmaster R. W. Jake Clare he sang in a trio of boy sopranos at among other occasions Westminster Abbey for Queen Elizabeth II. In 1959, Richards was expelled from Dartford Tech for truancy and transferred to Sidcup Art College where he met Dick Taylor. At Sidcup he was diverted from his studies proper and devoted more time to playing guitar with other students in the boys room. At this point Richards had learned most of Chuck Berrys solosRichards met Jagger again by chance on a train platform when Jagger was heading for classes at the London School of Economics. The mailorder rhythm and blues albums from Chess Records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters that Jagger was carrying revealed a mutual interest and led to a renewal of their friendship. Along with mutual friend Dick Taylor Jagger was singing in an amateur band Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys which Richards soon joined. The Blue Boys folded when Brian Jones after sharing thoughts on their joint interest in the blues music invited Mick and Keith to the Bricklayers Arms pub where they then met Ian StewartBy mid1962 Richards had left Sidcup Art College to devote himself to music and moved into a London flat with Jagger and Jones. His parents divorced at about the same time resulting in his staying close to his mother and remaining estranged from his father until 1982After the Rolling Stones signed to Decca Records in 1963, the bands manager Andrew Loog Oldham dropped the s from Richardss surname believing that Keith Richard in his words looked more pop and that it would echo the name of the British rock and roll singer Cliff Richard. During the late 1970s Richards reestablished the s in his surname.\n\nMusicianship\nRichards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts often in the same song the Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead weaving between him and the other guitarist in the band  Brian Jones 1962\u20131969) Mick Taylor 1969\u20131975) or Ronnie Wood 1975\u2013present. In the recording studio Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts notably on the songs Paint It Black Ruby Tuesday Sympathy for the Devil and Gimme Shelter. He is also a vocalist singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals such as on the Rolling Stones 1972 single Happy as well as with his side project the XPensive Winos.\n\nBandleader\nSince the departure of Brian Jones Richards and Mick Jagger have shared primary songwriting and production duties credited as the Glimmer Twins for the Stones. Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones bandleader however Richards has said that his job is merely oiling the machinery. Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones. Both former bassist Bill Wyman and current guitarist Ronnie Wood have said that the Stones did not follow the bands longtime drummer Charlie Watts but rather followed Richards as there was no way of not following him.\n\nGuitarist\nChris Spedding calls Richardss guitar playing direct incisive and unpretentious. Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the fastest gun in the west. Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards and with Jagger he introduced Berrys songs to the Rolling Stones early repertoire. In the late 1960s Brian Joness declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks including slide guitar. Joness replacement Mick Taylor played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974. Taylors virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles most notably onstage. In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called the ancient art of weaving which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago bluesA break in touring during 1967\u20131968 allowed Richards to experiment with open tunings. He mainly used open tunings for fingered chording developing a distinctive style of syncopated and ringing IIV chording heard on Street Fighting Man and Start Me Up. Richardss favoured  but not exclusively used  open tuning is a fivestring open G tuning GDGBD. Richards often removes the lowest string from his guitar playing with only five strings and letting the bands bass player pick up those notes as the lower string just gets in the way of Richardss playing. Several of his Telecasters are tuned this way. This tuning is prominent on Rolling Stones recordings including Honky Tonk Women Brown Sugar and Start Me Up. Richards has stated that banjo tuning was the inspiration for this tuningRichards regards acoustic guitar as the basis for his playing believing that the limitations of electric guitar would cause him to lose that touch if he stopped playing an acoustic. Richards plays acoustic guitar on many Rolling Stones tracks including Play with Fire Brown Sugar and Angie. All guitars on the studio versions of Street Fighting Man and Jumpin Jack Flash feature acoustic guitars overloaded to a cassette recorder then reamped through a loudspeaker in the studio.\n\nVocals\nRichards sang in a school choir  most notably for Queen Elizabeth II  until adolescences effect on his voice forced him out of it. He has sung backing vocals on every Rolling Stones album. Since Between the Buttons 1967) he has sung lead or colead on at least one track see list below of every Rolling Stones studio album except Their Satanic Majesties Request Sticky Fingers Its Only Rock n Roll and Blue  Lonesome.\nHe has sung lead on more than ten Rolling Stones songs including Happy You Got the Silver and Connection. During the Rolling Stones 1972 tour the Richardssung Happy entered into their concert repertoire and since then he has sung lead vocals on one or two songs each concert in order to give Jagger time to change his outfit. Keith usually starts with Max Miller routines such as Its nice to be here  its nice to be anywhere in order to give the audience a moment to catch its proverbial breath. During the 2006 and 2007 Rolling Stones tours Richards sang You Got the Silver 1969) without playing any instrument.\n\nSongwriting\nRichards and Jagger began writing songs together in 1963, prompted by manager Andrew Loog Oldham who believed the band could not depend on outside songwriters. The earliest JaggerRichards collaborations were recorded by other artists including Gene Pitney whose rendition of That Girl Belongs to Yesterday was their first topten single in the UK. They scored another topten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull As Tears Go By.\nThe first topten hit for the Rolling Stones with a Jagger and Richards original was The Last Time in early 1965; I Cant Get No Satisfaction also 1965) was their first international numberone recording. Richards has stated that the Satisfaction riff came to him in his sleep he woke up just long enough to record it on a cassette player by his bed. Since Aftermath 1966) most Rolling Stones albums have consisted mainly of Jagger and Richards originals. Their songs reflect the influence of blues RB rock and roll pop soul gospel and country as well as forays into psychedelia and Dylanesque social commentary. Their work in the 1970s and beyond has incorporated elements of funk disco reggae and punk. Richards has also written and recorded slow torchy ballads such as You Got the Silver 1969) Coming Down Again 1973) All About You 1980) and Slipping Away 1989). His songwriting partnership with Mick Jagger is one of the most successful in historyIn his solo career Richards has often shared cowriting credits with drummer and coproducer Steve Jordan. Richards has stated Ive always thought songs written by two people are better than those written by one. You get another angle on it.Richards has frequently expressed that he feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs I dont have that God aspect about it. I prefer to think of myself as an antenna. Theres only one song and Adam and Eve wrote it the rest is a variation on a theme. Richards was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nRecord production\nRichards has been active as a music producer since the 1960s. He was credited as producer and musical director on the 1966 album Todays Pop Symphony one of manager Andrew Loog Oldhams side projects although there are doubts about how much Richards was actually involved with it. On the Rolling Stones 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request the entire band was credited as producer but since 1974, Richards and Mick Jagger have frequently coproduced both Rolling Stones records and those by other artists under the name the Glimmer Twins often in collaboration with other producers.\nIn early 1973, Jagger and Richards developed an interest in the band Kracker resulting in a deal whereby the bands second album was licensed for distribution outside America by Rolling Stones Records making Kracker the first band on that labelSince the 1980s Richards has chalked up numerous production and coproduction credits on projects with other artists including Aretha Franklin Johnnie Johnson and Ronnie Spector as well as on his own albums with the XPensive Winos see below. In the 1990s Richards coproduced and added guitar and vocals to a recording of nyabinghi Rastafarian chanting and drumming entitled Wingless Angels released on Richardss own record label Mindless Records in 1997.\n\nSolo recordings\nRichards has released few solo recordings. His first solo single released in 1978, was a cover of Chuck Berrys Run Rudolph Run backed with his version of Jimmy Cliffs The Harder They Come. In 1987, after Jagger pursued a solo recording and touring career Richards formed the XPensive Winos with cosongwriter and coproducer Steve Jordan whom Richards assembled for his Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock n RollAdditional members of the XPensive Winos included guitarist Waddy Wachtel saxophonist Bobby Keys keyboardist Ivan Neville and Charley Drayton on bass. The first Winos record Talk Is Cheap also featured Bernie Worrell Bootsy Collins and Maceo Parker. Since its release Talk Is Cheap has gone gold and has sold consistently. Its release was followed by the first of the two US tours Richards has done as a solo artist. Live at the Hollywood Palladium 15 December 1988 documents the first of these tours. In 1992 the Winos second studio record Main Offender was released also followed by a tour. Although the Winos featured on both albums the albums were credited to Richards as a solo artist.\nA third Richards album Crosseyed Heart was released in September 2015.\n\nRecordings with other artists\nDuring the 1960s most of Richardss recordings with artists other than the Rolling Stones were sessions for Andrew Loog Oldhams Immediate Records label. Notable exceptions were when Richards along with Mick Jagger and numerous other guests sang on the Beatles 1967 TV broadcast of All You Need Is Love and when he played bass with John Lennon Eric Clapton Mitch Mitchell Ivry Gitlis and Yoko Ono as the Dirty Mac for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special filmed in 1968In the 1970s Richards worked outside the Rolling Stones with Ronnie Wood on several occasions contributing guitar piano and vocals to Woods first two solo albums and joining him on stage for two July 1974 concerts to promote Ive Got My Own Album to Do. In December 1974 Richards also made a guest appearance at a Faces concert. During 1976 and 1977, Richards both coproduced and played on John Phillipss solo recording Pay Pack  Follow released in 2001). In 1979 he toured the US with the New Barbarians the band that Wood put together to promote his album Gimme Some Neck he and Wood also contributed guitar and backing vocals to Truly on Ian McLagans 1979 album Troublemaker rereleased in 2005 as Here Comes Trouble.Since the 1980s Richards has made more frequent guest appearances. In 1981 he played on reggae singer Max Romeos album Holding Out My Love to You. He has worked with Tom Waits on three occasions adding guitar and backing vocals to Waitss album Rain Dogs 1985) cowriting playing on and sharing the lead vocal on That Feel on Bone Machine 1992) and adding guitar and vocals to Bad As Me 2011). In 1986 Richards produced and played on Aretha Franklins rendition of Jumpin Jack Flash and served as musical producer and band leader or as he phrased it SM director for the Chuck Berry film Hail! Hail! Rock n RollIn the 1990s and 2000s Richards continued to contribute to a wide range of musical projects as a guest artist. A few of the notable sessions he has done include guitar and vocals on Johnnie Johnsons 1991 release Johnnie B. Bad which he also coproduced and lead vocals and guitar on Oh Lord Dont Let Them Drop That Atomic Bomb on Me on the 1992 Charles Mingus tribute album Weird Nightmare. He duetted with country legend George Jones on Say Its Not You on the Bradley Barn Sessions 1994) a second duet from the same sessions Burn Your Playhouse Down appeared on Joness 2008 release Burn Your Playhouse Down  The Unreleased Duets. He partnered with Levon Helm on Deuce and a Quarter for Scotty Moores album All the Kings Men 1997). His guitar and lead vocals are featured on the Hank Williams tribute album Timeless 2001) and on veteran blues guitarist Hubert Sumlins album About Them Shoes 2005). Richards also added guitar and vocals to Toots  the Maytals recording of Careless Ethiopians for their 2004 album True Love which won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. Additionally in December 2007 Richards released a downloadonly Christmas single via iTunes of Run Rudolph Run and the Bside was a 2003 recorded version of the famous reggae song Pressure Drop featuring Toots Hibbert singing with Richards backed by original Maytals band members Jackie Jackson and Paul Douglas.\n\nRare and unreleased recordings\nIn 2005 the Rolling Stones released Rarities 1971\u20132003, which includes some rare and limitedissue recordings but Richards has described the bands released output as the tip of the iceberg. Many of the bands unreleased songs and studio jam sessions are widely bootlegged as are numerous Richards solo recordings including his 1977 Toronto studio sessions some 1981 studio sessions and tapes made during his 1983 wedding trip to Mexico.\n\nPublic image and personal life\nRelationships and family\nRichards was romantically involved with Italianborn actress Anita Pallenberg d. 13 June 2017) from 1967 to 1979, after which they remained cordial. Together they have a son Marlon Leon Sundeep named after the actor Marlon Brando born in 1969, and a daughter Angela originally named Dandelion born in 1972. Their third child a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunneafter Richardss and Pallenbergs friend Guinness heir Tara Brownedied aged just over two months of sudden infant death syndrome SIDS on 6 June 1976. Richards was away on tour at the time something he said has haunted him since. He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death but he later said it was the only way he could cope. Before they became romantically linked Pallenberg had been involved with his fellow Rolling Stones bandmate and close friend Brian Jones. The two became a couple on a trip to Morocco that Jones had to abandon when he fell ill the subsequent relationship between Richards and Pallenberg weighed heavily on Jones and strained his relationship with the rest of the Rolling StonesRichards met his wife model Patti Hansen in 1979. They married on 18 December 1983, Richardss 40th birthday and have two daughters Theodora Dupree and Alexandra Nicole born in 1985 and 1986, respectively. In September 2014 Richards published a childrens book with Theodora Gus and Me The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar. Theodora was reported as contributing pen and ink illustrations for the book which was inspired by the man she was named after Richardss grandfather Theodore Augustus Dupree.He has five grandchildren three from his son Marlon and two from his daughter Angela.\n\nFriendship with Mick Jagger\nRichardss relationship with bandmate Mick Jagger is frequently described as lovehate by the media. Richards himself said in a 1998 interview I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him its because no one else has the guts to do it or else theyre paid not to do it. At the same time Id hope Mick realises that Im a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done. Richards along with Johnny Depp tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jagger to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides alongside Depp and RichardsRichardss autobiography Life was published on 26 October 2010. Eleven days prior to its release the Associated Press published an article stating that in the book Richards refers to Jagger as unbearable and notes that their relationship has been strained for decades. His opinion softening by 2015, Richards still said Jagger could come off as a snob but added I still love him dearly ... your friends dont have to be perfect.\n\nDrug use and arrests\nMusic journalist Nick Kent attached to Richards Lord Byrons epithet of mad bad and dangerous to know. Jagger thought that Richardss image had contributed to him becoming a junkie. In 1994, Richards said his image was like a long shadow ... Even though that was nearly twenty years ago you cannot convince some people that Im not a mad drug addict.Richardss notoriety for illicit drug use stems in part from several drug busts during the late 1960s and 1970s and his candour about using heroin and other substances. Richards has been tried on drugrelated charges five times in 1967, twice in 1973, in 1977, and in 1978. The first trial  the only one culminating in a prison sentence  resulted from a February 1967 police raid on Redlands Richardss Sussex estate where he and some friends including Jagger were spending the weekend. The subsequent arrest of Richards and Jagger put them on trial before the British courts whilst also trying them in the court of public opinion. On 29 June 1967, Jagger was sentenced to three months imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets. Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point Jagger was taken to Brixton Prison in south London and Richards to Wormwood Scrubs Prison in west London. Both were released on bail the next day pending appeal. On 1 July The Times ran an editorial entitled Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel? portraying Jaggers sentence as persecution and public sentiment against the convictions increased. A month later the appeals court overturned Richardss conviction for lack of evidence and gave Jagger a conditional dischargeOn 27 February 1977, while Richards was staying in a Toronto hotel then known as the Harbour Castle Hilton on Queens Quay East the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found heroin in his room and charged him with possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking  an offence that at that time could result in prison sentences of seven years to life under the Narcotic Control Act. His passport was confiscated and Richards and his family remained in Toronto until 1 April when Richards was allowed to enter the United States on a medical visa for treatment of heroin addiction. The charge against him was later reduced to simple possession of heroin.For the next two years Richards lived under threat of criminal sanction. Throughout this period he remained active with the Rolling Stones recording their biggestselling studio album Some Girls and touring North America. Richards was tried in October 1978, pleading guilty to possession of heroin. He was given a suspended sentence and put on probation for one year with orders to continue treatment for heroin addiction and to perform a benefit concert on behalf of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind after a blind fan testified on his behalf. Although the prosecution had filed an appeal of the sentence Richards performed two CNIB benefit concerts at Oshawa Civic Auditorium on 22 April 1979; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians. In September 1979, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the original sentenceIn 2016, he stated that he still occasionally drinks alcohol and consumes hashish and cannabis. In 2022 he revealed that he quit smoking in 2020.\n\nOther details\nRichards owns Redlands a Sussex estate he purchased in 1966, as well as homes in Weston Connecticut and in the private resort island of Parrot Cay Turks  Caicos. His primary home is in Weston. In June 2013, Richards said that he would retire with his family to Parrot Cay or Jamaica if he knew his death was coming. However in November 2016, he said Id like to croak magnificently onstage. Richards is an avid reader with a strong interest in history and owns an extensive library. An April 2010 article revealed that Richards yearns to be a librarianRichards is fond of shepherds pie a British traditional dish. Stuart Cable recollected that while drummer for the Stereophonics he was confronted by Richards because he had served himself a piece of the shepherds pie meant for Richards. The dish was also mentioned by Richards in his autobiography advising readers to add more onions after cooking the meat filling to enhance the pies flavour.\n\n21st century\nOn 27 April 2006, while in Fiji Richards slipped off the branch of a dead tree erroneously reported by the international press as a coconut tree and suffered a head injury. He subsequently underwent cranial surgery at a New Zealand hospital. The incident delayed the Rolling Stones 2006 European tour for six weeks and forced the band to reschedule several shows. The revised tour schedule included a brief statement from Richards apologising for falling off my perch. The band made up most of the postponed dates in 2006, and toured Europe in 2007 to make up the remainder. In a video message in late 2013 as part of the On Fire tour Richards gave his thanks to the surgeons in New Zealand who treated him remarking I left half my brain there.In August 2006, Richards was granted a pardon by Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee for a 1975 reckless driving citationActor Johnny Depp has stated that his character in the movie franchise Pirates of the Caribbean is loosely based on Richards and the Warner Bros. cartoon character Pepe Le Pew with both serving as the inspiration for the manner of the character. This combination of influences originally raised concerns with Disney corporate executives who questioned if the character was supposed to be drunk and gay with Michael Eisner fearing that he was ruining the movie. In the third installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series At Worlds End Richards played Captain Edward Teague later reprising the role in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides the fourth film in the series 2011).In 2012, Richards joined the 11th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians careersIn a 2015 interview with the New York Daily News Richards expressed his dislike for rap and hip hop deeming them for tone deaf people and consisting of a drum beat and somebody yelling over it. In the same interview he called Metallica and Black Sabbath great jokes and bemoaned the lack of syncopation in most rock and roll claiming it sounds like a dull thud to me. He also said he stopped being a Beatles fan in 1967 when they visited the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi but this did not prevent him from playing bass in John Lennons pickup band The Dirty Mac for a performance of the Beatles song Yer Blues in the Stones Rock and Roll Circus in December 1968.\nFor the weekend of 23 September 2016, Richards together with director Julien Temple curated and hosted a threenight programme on BBC Four titled Lost Weekend. Richardss choices consisted of his favourite 1960s comedy shows cartoons and thrillers interspersed with interviews rare musical performances and night imagery. This televisual journey was the first of its kind on British TV. Temple also directed a documentary The Origin of the Species about Richardss childhood in postwar England and his musical roots.\n\nTributes for other artists\nFrom the start of his career Richards has made appearances to pay tribute to those artists with whom he has formed friendships and those who have inspired and encouraged him. After the earliest success of the band who played cover songs of American blues artists while he and Jagger were just beginning their own songwriting the Rolling Stones visited the States to pay back in his words thats where that fame bit comes in handy. Since that time he has performed on many occasions to show appreciation toward them. Among these he has appeared with Norah Jones in a tribute concert for Gram Parsons in 2006, playing guitar and singing a duet Love Hurts. On 12 March 2007 Richards attended the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame ceremony to induct the Ronettes he also played guitar during the ceremonys allstar jam session. On 26 February 2012 Richards paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston MassachusettsRichards is interviewed on screen and appears in performance footage in the 2005 documentary film Make It Funky which presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues rock and roll funk and jazz. In the film Richards said that New Orleans musicians put the roll into rock. He also performed the Fats Domino song Im Ready with the house bandIn an April 2007 interview for NME magazine music journalist Mark Beaumont asked Richards what the strangest thing he ever snorted was and quoted him as replying My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldnt resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow. My dad wouldnt have cared ... It went down pretty well and Im still alive. In the media uproar that followed Richardss manager said that the anecdote had been meant as a joke Beaumont told Uncut magazine that the interview had been conducted by international telephone and that he had misquoted Richards at one point reporting that Richards had said he listens to Mot\u00f6rhead when what he had said was Mozart but that he believed the ashsnorting anecdote was true. Musician Jay Farrar from the band Son Volt wrote a song titled Cocaine And Ashes which was inspired by Richardss drug habits. The incident was also referenced in the 2017 song Mr Charisma by The Waterboys featuring the lyrics Hey Mr Charisma what will your next trick be? Slagging Sgt Pepper snorting your old mans bones or falling out of a tree?\nDoris Richards his mother died of cancer at the age of 91 in England on 21 April 2007.

Richards reprised his role in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides released in May 2011.\n\nIn March 2008, the fashion house Louis Vuitton unveiled an advertising campaign featuring a photo of Richards with his ebony Gibson ES355, taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. Richards donated the fee for his involvement to the Climate Project an organisation for raising environmental awarenessOn 28 October 2008, Richards appeared at the Musicians Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Nashville Tennessee joining the newly inducted the Crickets on stage for performances of Peggy Sue Not Fade Away and Thatll Be the Day.In August 2009, Richards was ranked at No. 4 in Time magazines list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. In September 2009 Richards told Rolling Stone magazine that in addition to anticipating a new Rolling Stones album he had done some recording with Jack White I enjoy working with Jack he said. Weve done a couple of tracks. On 17 October 2009 Richards received the Rock Immortal Award at Spike TVs Scream 2009 awards ceremony at the Greek Theatre Los Angeles the award was presented by Johnny Depp. I liked the living legend that was all right Richards said referring to an award he received in 1989, but immortal is even better.In 2009, a book of Richardss quotations was published titled What Would Keith Richards Do Daily Affirmations from a Rock n Roll SurvivorIn August 2007, Richards signed a publishing deal for his autobiography Life which was released on 26 October 2010Richards appeared in the 2011 documentary Toots and the Maytals Reggae Got Soul which was featured on the BBC and described as the untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica.\n\nHonours\nIn 2010, David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine referred to Richards as the creator of rocks greatest single body of riffs on guitar and the magazine ranked him fourth on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone also lists fourteen songs he cowrote with Jagger on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time listIn 2023, Tom Waits honored his friend with a poem Burnt Toast To Keith. That same year Richards was honoured in Dartford with a statue.\n\nMusical equipment\nGuitars\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars. Even though he has used many different guitar models in a 1986 Guitar World interview Richards joked that no matter what model he plays Give me five minutes and Ill make em all sound the same. Richards has often thanked Leo Fender and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nAmplifiers\nRichardss amplifier preferences have changed repeatedly but he is a longtime proponent of using lowpowered amps in the studio getting clarity plus distortion by using two amps a larger one such as a Fender Twin run clean along with a Fender Champ which is overdriven. To record Crosseyed Heart Richards used a stock tweed Fender Champ with 8\" speaker coupled with a modified Fender HarvardSome of his notable amplifiers are\n\nMesaBoogie Mark 1 A804  Used between 1977 and 1993, this 100-watt 1x12\" combo is finished in hardwood with a wicker grille.

This amplifier was handcrafted by Randall Smith and delivered to Richards in March 1977.\nFender Twin  Since the 1990s Richards has tended to use a variety of Fender tweed Twins on stage.

In the 1970s and early 1980s Richards frequently used guitar effects such as a wahwah pedal a phaser and a Leslie speaker but he has mainly relied on combining the right amp with the right guitar to achieve the sound he wants.\n\nDiscography\nTalk Is Cheap 1988)\nMain Offender 1992)\nCrosseyed Heart 2015)\n\nFilmography\nBibliography\n2010: Life\n2014: Gus  Me The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nKeith Richards at AllMusic\nKeith Richards at IMDb\nKeith Richards on National Public Radio in 2010\nKeith Richards at the Songwriters Hall of Fame\nCBC Archives Richardss trial and sentencing in 24 October 1978 and 16 April 1979\nRichards_Keith at Curlie", "George Harrison  25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English musician singer and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called the quiet Beatle Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindualigned spirituality in the Beatles work. Although the majority of the bands songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include Taxman Within You Without You While My Guitar Gently Weeps Here Comes the Sun and Something. Harrisons earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt subsequent influences were Carl Perkins Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry.\nBy 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments such as the sitar which he had become acquainted with on the set of the film Help! He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs starting with Norwegian Wood This Bird Has Flown. Having initiated the bands embrace of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the bands breakup in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single My Sweet Lord and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974. He cofounded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupes comedy film The Life of Brian 1979).\nHarrison released several bestselling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he cofounded the platinumselling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan Eric Clapton Ringo Starr and Tom Petty. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 31 in their 2023 list of greatest guitarists of all time. He is a twotime Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee  as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004Harrisons first marriage to model Pattie Boyd in 1966 ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married Olivia Arias with whom he had a son Dhani. A lifelong cigarette smoker Harrison died of numerous cancers in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home Friar Park. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost 100 million.\n\nEarly years 1943\u20131958\nHarrison was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree Liverpool on 25 February 1943. He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves or Hargrove Harrison 1909\u20131978) and Louise n\u00e9e French 1911\u20131970). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ships steward on the White Star Line and Louise was a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent. He had one sister Louise 16 August 1931  29 January 2023) and two brothers Harold born 1934) and Peter 20 July 1940  1 June 2007).According to Boyd Harrisons mother was particularly supportive All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy and she recognised that nothing made George quite as happy as making music. Louise was an enthusiastic music fan and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons windows. When Louise was pregnant with George she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrisons biographer Joshua Greene wrote Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.Harrison lived at 12 Arnold Grove for the first four years of his life. A terraced house on a culdesac it had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green Speke. In 1948, at the age of five Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the elevenplus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars and felt that the school moulded students into being frightened.Harrisons earliest musical influences included George Formby Cab Calloway Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael by the 1950s Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences. In early 1956, he had an epiphany while riding his bicycle he heard Elvis Presleys Heartbreak Hotel playing from a nearby house and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll. He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks and later commented I was totally into guitars. Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.At first Harold Harrison was apprehensive about his sons interest in pursuing a music career. However in 1956, he bought George a Dutch Egmond flattop acoustic guitar which according to Harold cost 310s equivalent to 90 in 2024). One of his fathers friends taught Harrison how to play Whispering Sweet Sue and Dinah. Inspired by Donegans music Harrison formed a skiffle group the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school Harrison met Paul McCartney who also attended the Liverpool Institute and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.\n\nThe Beatles 1958\u20131970\nMcCartney and his friend John Lennon were in a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. In March 1958, at McCartneys urging Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storms Morgue Skiffle Club playing Arthur Guitar Boogie Smiths Guitar Boogie Shuffle but Lennon felt that Harrison having just turned 15, was too young to join the band. McCartney arranged a second meeting on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental Raunchy. He began socialising with the group filling in on guitar as needed and then became accepted as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers a local department store. During the groups first tour of Scotland in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym Carl Harrison in reference to Carl Perkins.\nIn 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band now calling themselves the Beatles to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg both owned by Bruno Koschmider. Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with EMI. The groups first single Love Me Do peaked at number 17 on the Record Retailer chart and by the time their debut album Please Please Me was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with the band Harrison was known as the quiet Beatle. That moniker arose when the Beatles arrived in the United States in early 1964, and Harrison was ill with a case of Strep throat and a fever and was medically advised to limit speaking as much as possible until he performed on The Ed Sullivan Show as scheduled. As such the press noticed Harrisons apparent laconic nature in public appearances on that tour and the subsequent nickname stuck much to Harrisons amusement. He had two lead vocal credits on the LP including the LennonMcCartney song Do You Want to Know a Secret? and three on their second album With the Beatles 1963). The latter included Dont Bother Me Harrisons first solo writing credit.\nHarrison served as the Beatles scout for new American releases being especially knowledgeable about soul music. By 1965's Rubber Soul he had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood This Bird Has Flown. He later called Rubber Soul his favourite Beatles album. Revolver 1966) included three of his compositions Taxman selected as the albums opening track Love You To and I Want to Tell You. His dronelike tambura part on Lennons Tomorrow Never Knows exemplified the bands ongoing exploration of nonWestern instruments while the sitar and tablabased Love You To represented the Beatles first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following Harrisons increased association with the sitar after Norwegian Wood he became known as the maharaja of ragarock. Harrison continued to develop his interest in nonWestern instrumentation playing swarmandal on Strawberry Fields Forever.By late 1966, Harrisons interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indianinspired Within You Without You to which no other Beatle contributed. He played sitar and tambura on the track backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba swarmandal and tabla. He later commented on the Sgt. Pepper album It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... Theres about half the songs I like and the other half I cant stand.In January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song The Inner Light at EMIs studio in Bombay using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the Bside to McCartneys Lady Madonna it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching the songs lyric reflected Harrisons deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation. During the recording of The Beatles that same year tensions within the group ran high and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly. Harrisons four songwriting contributions to the double album included While My Guitar Gently Weeps which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar and the horndriven Savoy Truffle.\nDylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Bands sense of communal musicmaking and to the creative equality among the band members which contrasted with Lennon and McCartneys domination of the Beatles songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles. Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at Twickenham Studios during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary Let It Be. Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio by Lennons creative disengagement from the Beatles and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned 12 days later after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own Apple Studio and to abandon McCartneys plan for making a return to public performance.\n\nRelations among the Beatles were more cordial though still strained when the band recorded their 1969 album Abbey Road. The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as two classic contributions from Harrison  Here Comes the Sun and Something  that saw him finally achieve equal songwriting status with Lennon and McCartney. During the albums recording Harrison asserted more creative control than before rejecting suggestions for changes to his music particularly from McCartney. Something became his first Aside when issued on a double Aside single with Come Together the song was number one in Canada Australia New Zealand and West Germany and the combined sides topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. In the 1970s Frank Sinatra recorded Something twice 1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it the greatest love song of the past fifty years. Lennon considered it the best song on Abbey Road and it became the Beatles second most covered song after Yesterday.In May 1970, Harrisons song For You Blue was coupled on a US single with McCartneys The Long and Winding Road and became Harrisons second charttopper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100. His increased productivity meant that by the time of their breakup he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs increasing his frustration and significantly contributing to the bands breakup. Harrisons last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he McCartney and Starr recorded overdubs to the song Let It Be for the soundtrack album of the same name.\n\nSolo career 1968\u20131987\nEarly solo work 1968\u20131969\nBefore the Beatles breakup Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. Wonderwall Music a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall blends Indian and Western instrumentation while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album which contains the experimental sound collage Dream Scene recorded several months before Lennons Revolution 9\".In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney  Bonnie and Friends. During the tour which included Clapton Bobby Whitlock drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett Harrison began to play slide guitar and also began to write My Sweet Lord which became his first single as a solo artist.\n\nAll Things Must Pass 1970\nFor many years Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles albums but he released All Things Must Pass a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends. The album was regarded by many as his best work and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The numberone hit single My Sweet Lord and the topten single What Is Life were taken from the album which was coproduced by Phil Spector using his Wall of Sound approach the musicians included Starr Clapton Gary Wright Billy Preston Klaus Voormann the whole of Delaney and Bonnies Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger. On its release All Things Must Pass was received with critical acclaim Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described it as being of classic Spectorian proportions Wagnerian Brucknerian the music of mountain tops and vast horizons. Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the albums title track a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion to Harrisons former band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over My Sweet Lord owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit Hes So Fine. When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song but lost the case as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciouslyIn 2000, Apple Records released a thirtiethanniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview he reflected on the work Its just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion. He commented on the production Well in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact I dont use reverb at all. I cant stand it ... You know its hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now.\n\nThe Concert for Bangladesh 1971\nHarrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event the Concert for Bangladesh which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New Yorks Madison Square Garden. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Shankar opened the show which featured popular musicians such as Dylan Clapton Leon Russell Badfinger Preston and StarrA triple album The Concert for Bangladesh was released by Apple in December followed by a concert film in 1972. Credited to George Harrison and Friends the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds but Harrison commented Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was we spread the word and helped get the war ended.\n\nLiving in the Material World to George Harrison 1973\u20131979\nHarrisons 1973 album Living in the Material World held the number one spot on the Billboard albums chart for five weeks and the albums single Give Me Love Give Me Peace on Earth also reached number one in the US. In the UK the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged and its dominant message was Harrisons Hindu beliefs. In Greenes opinion it contained many of the strongest compositions of his career. Stephen Holden writing in Rolling Stone felt the album was vastly appealing and profoundly seductive and that it stood alone as an article of faith miraculous in its radiance. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic describing the release as awkward sanctimonious and overly sentimentalIn November 1974, Harrison became the first exBeatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour. The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and Tom Scott and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by Ravi Shankar Family and Friends. Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative. Some fans found Shankars significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrisons sermonizing. Further he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs and his laryngitisaffected vocals led to some critics calling the tour dark hoarse. The author Robert Rodriguez commented While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure there were a number of fans who were tunedin to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated. Simon Leng called the tour groundbreaking and revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music.On 16 November 1974, Harrison and several others involved in the tour visited the White House. They were invited by President Gerald Fords son JackIn December Harrison released Dark Horse which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. Rolling Stone called it the chronicle of a performer out of his element working to a deadline enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new LP product rehearse a band and assemble a crosscountry tour all within three weeks. The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single Dark Horse reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK. The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as one of Harrisons most fascinating works  a record about change and loss.\nHarrisons final studio album for EMI and Apple Records the soul musicinspired Extra Texture Read All About It 1975) peaked at number 8 on the Billboard chart and number 16 in the UK. Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified bitterness and dismay in many of the tracks his longtime friend Klaus Voormann commented He wasnt up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around and thats when I got out of the picture ... I didnt like his frame of mind. He released two singles from the LP You which reached the Billboard top 20, and This Guitar Cant Keep from Crying Apples final original single releaseThirty Three  1/3 1976) Harrisons first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label produced the hit singles This Song and Crackerbox Palace both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The surreal humour of Crackerbox Palace reflected Harrisons association with Monty Pythons Eric Idle who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works Thirty Three  1/3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass. The album peaked just outside the top ten there but outsold his previous two LPs. As part of his promotion for the release Harrison performed on Saturday Night Live with Paul SimonIn 1979, Harrison released George Harrison which followed his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani. Coproduced by Russ Titelman the album and the single Blow Away both made the Billboard top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrisons gradual retreat from the music business with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago. Leng described George Harrison as melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss.\n\nSomewhere in England to Cloud Nine 1980\u20131987\nThe murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decadeslong concern about stalkers. The tragedy was also a deep personal loss although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before Lennon was killed. Following the murder Harrison commented After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned. Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make the song a tribute to Lennon. All Those Years Ago which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney as well as Starrs original drum part peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public. During this period he made several guest appearances including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled Blue Suede Shoes A Rockabilly Session. In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Childrens Hospital. The following year he appeared at The Princes Trust concert at Londons Wembley Arena performing While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Here Comes the Sun. In February 1987 he joined Dylan John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a twohour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers  and had a few more ... Bob says Hey why dont we all get up and play and you can sing? But every time I got near the microphone Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear trying to throw me.In November 1987, Harrison released the platinum album Cloud Nine. Coproduced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra ELO the album included Harrisons rendition of James Rays Got My Mind Set on You which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay and another single When We Was Fab a retrospective of the Beatles career earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park Harrisons slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album which included several of his longtime musical collaborators including Clapton Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart  Devils Radio This Is Love and Cloud 9\".\n\nLater career 1988\u20131996\nThe Traveling Wilburys and return to touring 1988\u20131992\nIn 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne Roy Orbison Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylans garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release. Harrisons record company decided the track Handle with Care was too good for its original purpose as a Bside and asked for a full album. The LP Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as halfbrothers supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury Sr. It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US where it was certified triple platinum. Harrisons pseudonym on the album was Nelson Wilbury he used the name Spike Wilbury for their second albumIn 1989, Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Pettys song I Wont Back Down. In October that year Harrison assembled and released Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989, a compilation of his later solo work. The album included three new songs including Cheer Down which Harrison had recently contributed to the Lethal Weapon 2 film soundtrackFollowing Orbisons death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a fourpiece. Their second album issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3. According to Lynne That was Georges idea. He said Lets confuse the buggers. It peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US where it was certified platinum. The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second albumIn December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan. It was Harrisons first since 1974 and no others followed. On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall his first London performance since the Beatles 1969 rooftop concert. In October 1992, he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City playing alongside Dylan Clapton McGuinn Petty and Neil Young.\n\nThe Beatles Anthology 1994\u20131996\nIn 1994, Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the Beatles Anthology project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles career. Released in December 1995, Free as a Bird was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single Real Love. They also attempted to finish a third single Now and Then but did not finish it because the audio quality of the cassette was according to Harrison fucking rubbish. The song was later finished by McCartney and Starr and released in 2023. He later commented on the project I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when Im dead make them into hit songs.\n\nLater life and death 1997\u20132001\nAfter the Anthology project Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latters Chants of India. Harrisons final television appearance was a VH1 special to promote the album taped in May 1997. Soon afterwards Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer he was treated with radiotherapy which was thought at the time to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illnessIn January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins funeral in Jackson Tennessee where he performed a brief rendition of Perkins song Your True Love. In May he represented the Beatles at Londons High Court in their successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the band at the StarClub in Hamburg. The following year he was the most active of the former Beatles in promoting the reissue of their 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine.\nOn 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife Olivia were attacked at their home Friar Park. Michael Abram a 34-yearold paranoid schizophrenic broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before his wife incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Harrison later commented I felt exhausted and could feel the strength draining from me. I vividly remember a deliberate thrust to my chest. I could hear my lung exhaling and had blood in my mouth. I believed I had been fatally stabbed. Following the attack Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds and part of his punctured lung was removed. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant He wasnt a burglar and he certainly wasnt auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys. Adi Shankara an Indian historical spiritual and groovytype person once said Life is fragile like a raindrop on a lotus leaf. And youd better believe it. Upon being released from a mental hospital in 2002, Abram said If I could turn back the clock I would give anything not to have done what I did in attacking George Harrison but looking back on it now I have come to understand that I was at the time not in control of my actions. I can only hope the Harrison family might somehow find it in their hearts to accept my apologies.The injuries inflicted on Harrison during the home invasion were downplayed by his family in their comments to the press. Having seen Harrison looking so healthy beforehand those in his social circle believed that the attack brought about a change in him and was the cause for his cancers return. In May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs and in July it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland Starr visited him but had to cut short his stay to travel to Boston where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery. Harrison who was very weak quipped Do you want me to come with you? In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for nonsmall cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was made public Harrison bemoaned his physicians breach of privacy and his estate later claimed damagesOn 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a property belonging to McCartney on Heather Road in Beverly Hills Los Angeles. He was 58 years old. He died in the company of Olivia Dhani Shankar and the latters wife Sukanya and daughter Anoushka and Hare Krishna devotees Shyamasundar Das and Mukunda Goswami who chanted verses from the Bhagavad Gita. His final message to the world as relayed in a statement by Olivia and Dhani was Everything else can wait but the search for God cannot wait and love one another. He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his funeral was held at the SelfRealization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades California. His close family scattered his ashes according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi India. He left almost 100 million in his willHarrisons final studio album Brainwashed 2002) was released posthumously after it was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. A quotation from the Bhagavad Gita is included in the albums liner notes There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be. A mediaonly single Stuck Inside a Cloud which Leng describes as a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality achieved number 27 on Billboards Adult Contemporary chart. The single Any Road released in May 2003, peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. Marwa Blues went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance while Any Road was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nMusicianship\nGuitar work\nHarrisons guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s. His rhythm guitar playing was innovative for example when he used a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar as on the Rubber Soul 1965) album and Here Comes the Sun to create a bright sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was clearly an innovator as he was taking certain elements of RB and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique. Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song. The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as another early influenceIn 1961, the Beatles recorded Cry for a Shadow a bluesinspired instrumental cowritten by Lennon and Harrison who is credited with composing the songs lead guitar part building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows. Harrisons liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Another of Harrisons musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves as on Ill Be on My Way.By 1964, he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones as with the ending chord arpeggios on A Hard Days Night. On this and other songs from the period he used a Rickenbacker 360/12  an electric guitar with twelve strings the low eight of which are tuned in pairs one octave apart with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. His use of the Rickenbacker on A Hard Days Night helped to popularise the model and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles secret weapon. In 1965, Harrison used an expression pedal to control his guitars volume on I Need You creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements. He used the same volumeswell technique on Yes It Is applying what Everett described as ghostly articulation to the songs natural harmonicsIn 1966, Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennons composition Im Only Sleeping and a guitar countermelody on And Your Bird Can Sing that moved in parallel octaves above McCartneys bass downbeats. His guitar playing on I Want to Tell You exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds mirrors Lennons vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.\n\nEverett described Harrisons guitar solo from Old Brown Shoe as stinging and highly Claptonesque. He identified two of the compositions significant motifs a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo. In Greenes opinion Harrisons demo for Old Brown Shoe contains one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song.Harrisons playing on Abbey Road and in particular on Something marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The songs guitar solo shows a varied range of influences incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack Something meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrisons guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity it reaches toward the sublime.After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments including the sarangi and the dilruba. Leng described Harrisons slide guitar solo on Lennons How Do You Sleep? as a departure for the sweet soloist of Something calling his playing rightly famed ... one of Harrisons greatest guitar statements. Lennon commented Thats the best hes ever fucking played in his life.A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrisons music ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo 1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea on ukulele in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrisons slide playing on the Grammywinning instrumental Marwa Blues 2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena calling it yet another demonstration of Harrisons unique slide approach. Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of Free as a Bird. He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on a few tracks including the Beatles songs She Said She Said Golden Slumbers Birthday and Honey Pie. He also played bass on several solo recordings including Faster Wake Up My Love and Bye Bye Love.\n\nSitar and Indian music\nDuring the Beatles American tour in August 1965, Harrisons friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison described Shankar as the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didnt try to impress me. Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli Harrisons introduction of the instrument on the Beatles song Norwegian Wood opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music triggering what Shankar would call The Great Sitar Explosion of 1966\u201367\". Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as the man most responsible for this phenomenon.In June 1966, Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle asked to be his student and was accepted. Before this meeting Harrison had recorded his Revolver track Love You To contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an astonishing improvement over Norwegian Wood and the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician. On 6 July Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram  Sons in New Delhi. In September following the Beatles final tour he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir. During this visit he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das Shankars prot\u00e9g\u00e9Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his roots an encounter with Clapton and Jimi Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented I decided ... Im not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier. Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most mainstream exposure to nonWestern musics or the concept of world music.\n\nSongwriting\nHarrison wrote his first song Dont Bother Me while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as an exercise to see if I could write a song as he remembered. His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles career but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon McCartney and producer George Martin until near the groups breakup. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon Until this year our songs have been better than Georges. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours. Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions three of his songs appear on Revolver the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter according to Inglis.\n\nHarrison wrote the chord progression of Dont Bother Me almost exclusively in the Dorian mode demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone Harrisons openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... Taxman and I Want to Tell You was revolutionary in popular music  and perhaps more originally creative than the avantgarde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen Luciano Berio Edgard Var\u00e8se and Igor Stravinsky ...Of the 1967 Harrison song Within You Without You author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a new form calling the composition a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music. Lennon called the song one of Harrisons best His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent he brought that sound together. In his next fully Indianstyled song The Inner Light Harrison embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music rather than the Hindustani style he had used in Love You To and Within You Without You. Writing in 1997, Farrell commented It is a mark of Harrisons sincere involvement with Indian music that nearly thirty years on the Beatles Indian songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion  for example Blue Jay Way and The Inner Light.Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Something as a masterpiece and an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge Yesterday and Michelle as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced. Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrisons development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrisons two contributions to the LP Here Comes the Sun and Something as exquisite declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.\n\nCollaborations\nFrom 1968 onwards Harrison collaborated with other musicians he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on While My Guitar Gently Weeps for the 1968 Beatles White Album and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album Wonderwall Music which included contributions from Clapton again as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees. He played on tracks by Dave Mason Nicky Hopkins Alvin Lee Ronnie Wood Billy Preston and Tom Scott. Harrison cowrote songs and music with Dylan Clapton Preston Doris Troy David Bromberg Gary Wright Wood Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty among others. Harrisons music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy Jackie Lomax and Billy PrestonHarrison cowrote the song Badge with Clapton which was included on Creams 1969 album Goodbye. Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track using the pseudonym LAngelo Misterioso for contractual reasons. In May 1970, he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylans album New Morning. Between 1971 and 1973, he cowrote andor produced three top ten hits for Starr It Dont Come Easy Back Off Boogaloo and Photograph. Aside from How Do You Sleep? his contributions to Lennons 1971 album Imagine included a slide guitar solo on Gimme Some Truth and dobro on Crippled Inside. Also that year he produced and played slide guitar on Badfingers top ten hit Day After Day and a dobro on Prestons I Wrote a Simple Song. He worked with Harry Nilsson on Youre Breakin My Heart 1972) and with Cheech  Chong on Basketball Jones 1973).In 1974, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented Hes extremely generous and he backs and supports all sorts of people that youll never ever hear of. The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo Splinter. Harrison produced and made multiple musical contributions to Splinters debut album The Place I Love which provided Dark Horse with its first hit Costafine Town. He also produced and played guitar and autoharp on Shankars Shankar Family  Friends the labels other inaugural release. Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes Henry McCullough Jiva and StairstepsHarrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scotts 1975 album New York Connection and in 1981 he played guitar on Walk a Thin Line from Mick Fleetwoods The Visitor. His contributions to Starrs solo career continued with Wrack My Brain a 1981 US top 40 hit written and produced by Harrison and guitar overdubs to two tracks on Vertical Man 1998). In 1996, Harrison recorded Distance Makes No Difference With Love with Carl Perkins for the latters album Go Cat Go and in 1990, he played slide guitar on the title track of Dylans Under the Red Sky album. In 2001, he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestras comeback album Zoom and on the song Love Letters for Bill Wymans Rhythm Kings. He also cowrote a new song with his son Dhani Horse to the Water which was recorded on 2 October eight weeks before his death. It appeared on Jools Hollands album Small World Big Band.\n\nGuitars\nWhen Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958, his main guitar was a H\u00f6fner President Acoustic which he soon traded for a H\u00f6fner Club 40 model. His first solidbody electric guitar was a Czechbuilt Jolana FuturamaGrazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models played through a Vox amplifier including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961 and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine 1987). He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman which he played on She Loves You and during the Beatles 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963, he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year most notably on the song Nowhere Man.In early 1966, Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word Bebopalula above the pickguard and the guitars nickname Rocky on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour 1967) film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul  that had been stripped of its original finish and stained cherry red which Harrison nicknamed Lucy. Around this time he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J200 acoustic guitar which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custommade Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.\n\nFilm production and HandMade films\nHarrison helped finance Ravi Shankars documentary Raga and released it through Apple Films in 1971. He also produced with Apple manager Allen Klein the Concert for Bangladesh film. In 1973, he produced the feature film Little Malcolm but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with KleinIn 1973, Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis OBrien. Soon after the two went into business together. In 1978, to produce Monty Pythons Life of Brian they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive Bernard Delfont. Harrison financed the production of Life of Brian in part by mortgaging his home which Idle later called the most anybodys ever paid for a cinema ticket in history. The film grossed 21 million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday 1980) and the first they produced was Time Bandits 1981) a coscripted project by Monty Pythons Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin. The film featured a new song by Harrison Dream Away in the closing credits. Time Bandits became one of HandMades most successful and acclaimed efforts with a budget of 5 million it earned 35 million in the US within ten weeks of its releaseHarrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade including A Private Function 1984) Mona Lisa 1986) Shanghai Surprise 1986) Withnail and I 1987) and How to Get Ahead in Advertising 1989). He made cameo appearances in several of these films including a role as a nightclub singer in Shanghai Surprise for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis Harrisons executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis producing some of the countrys most memorable movies of the 1980s. Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s and excessive debt incurred by OBrien which was guaranteed by Harrison HandMades financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment a Canadian corporation. Afterwards Harrison sued OBrien for 25 million for fraud and negligence resulting in an 116 million judgement in 1996.\n\nHumanitarian work\nHarrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song Bangla Desh which became pop musics first charity single when issued by Apple Records in late July. He also pushed Apple to release Shankars Joi Bangla EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause. Shankar asked for Harrisons advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh which raised more than 240,000. Around 135 million was generated through the album and film releases although most of the funds were frozen in an Internal Revenue Service audit for ten years due to Kleins failure to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar and Klein with the Child Is the Father of Man award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for BangladeshFrom 1980, Harrison became a vocal supporter of Greenpeace and CND. He also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth and helped finance Vole a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. In 1990, he helped promote his wife Olivias Romanian Angel Appeal on behalf of the thousands of Romanian orphans left abandoned by the state following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Harrison recorded a benefit single Nobodys Child with the Traveling Wilburys and assembled a fundraising album with contributions from other artists including Clapton Starr Elton John Stevie Wonder Donovan and Van MorrisonThe Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the largescale charity rock shows that followed including Live Aid. The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, they donated 450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.\n\nPersonal life\nHinduism\nBy the mid1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga Swami Vishnudevananda who gave each of them a signed copy of his book The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions he made a pilgrimage to India with his first wife Pattie Boyd there he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar met several gurus and visited various holy places. In 1968, he travelled with the other Beatles to Rishikesh in northern India to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh YogiHarrisons experiences with LSD in the mid1960s served as a catalyst for his early pursuance of Hinduism. In a 1977 interview George recalled\n\nFor me it was like a flash. The first time I had acid it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me and I realized a lot of things. I didnt learn them because I already knew them but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that I wanted to have it all the time  these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas and Ravis music.\nHowever Harrison stopped using LSD after a disenchanting experience in San Franciscos HaightAshbury neighborhood. He recounted in The Beatles Anthology\n\nThat was the turning point for me  thats when I went right off the whole drug cult and stopped taking the dreaded lysergic acid. I had some in a little bottle  it was liquid. I put it under a microscope and it looked like bits of old rope. I thought that I couldnt put that into my brain any more.\nIn line with the Hindu yoga tradition Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda  yogis and authors respectively of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid1969, he produced the single Hare Krishna Mantra performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain Harrison then met their leader AC. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada whom he described as my friend ... my master and a perfect example of everything he preached. Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition particularly japayoga chanting with beads and became a lifelong devotee. In 1972 he donated his Letchmore Heath mansion north of London to the devotees. It was later converted to a temple and renamed Bhaktivedanta ManorRegarding other faiths he once remarked All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesnt matter what you call Him just as long as you call. He commented on his beliefs\n\nKrishna actually was in a body as a person ... What makes it complicated is if hes God whats he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out and again it was Yoganandas spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point  that were in these bodies which is like a kind of chariot and were going through this incarnation this life which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says Please Krishna you drive the chariot because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... were going to crash our chariot and were going to turn over and were going to get killed in the battlefield. Thats why we say Hare Krishna Hare Krishna asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.\nInglis comments that in contrast to Cliff Richards conversion to Christianity in 1966: Harrisons spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular musics increasing maturity ... what he and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs.\n\nFamily and interests\nHarrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met on set in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Days Night in which the 19-yearold Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. During a lunch break George playfully proposed to her. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to Georges repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringos wife Maureen which Boyd called the final straw. She characterised the last year of their marriage as fuelled by alcohol and cocaine and she stated George used coke excessively and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart. She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton and they married in 1979On 2 September 1978, Harrison married Olivia Trinidad Arias who was a marketing executive for AM Records and later Dark Horse Records. As Dark Horse was a subsidiary of AM the couple had first met over the phone working on record company business and then in person at the AM Records offices in Los Angeles in 1974. Together they had one son Dhani Harrison born on 1 August 1978Harrison restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park his home in HenleyonThames where several of his music videos including Crackerbox Palace were filmed the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the 36-acre 15 ha garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism Sometimes I feel like Im actually on the wrong planet and its great when Im in my garden but the minute I go out the gate I think What the hell am I doing here? His autobiography I Me Mine is dedicated to gardeners everywhere. The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book which said little about the Beatles focusing instead on Harrisons hobbies music and lyrics. Taylor commented George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young at 12, he had attended his first race the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He wrote Faster as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson. Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity set up after the Swedish drivers death from the disease in 1978. Harrisons first extravagant car a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid 350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.\n\nRelationships with the other Beatles\nFor most of the Beatles career the relationships in the group were close. According to Hunter Davies the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life but communally living the same life. They were each others greatest friends. Harrisons exwife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles all belonged to each other and admitted George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody not even the wives can break through or even comprehend it. Starr said We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days wed have the biggest hotel suites the whole floor of the hotel and the four of us would end up in the bathroom just to be with each other. He added there were some really loving caring moments between four people a hotel room here and there  a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was one of young follower and older guy ... he was like a disciple of mine when we started. The two later bonded over their LSD experiences finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter with according to biographer Gary Tillery Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974, Harrison said of his former bandmate John Lennon is a saint and hes heavyduty and hes great and I love him. But at the same time hes such a bastard  but thats the great thing about him you see?Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet having shared a school bus and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney said that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his baby brother. In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman Harrison stated McCartney ruined me as a guitar player. In the same interview however Harrison stated that I just know that whatever weve been through theres always been something thats tied us together. Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartneys personal relationship as both men admitted that they often got on each others nerves. Rodriguez commented Even to the end of Georges days theirs was a volatile relationship. When in a Yahoo! online chat in February 2001, he was asked if Paul pisses you off Harrison replied Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass  You know his faults  Then let his foibles pass. Old Victorian Proverb. Im sure theres enough about me that pisses him off but I think we have now grown old enough to realize that were both pretty damn cute!\n\nLegacy\nIn June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire MBE. They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be. The minor planet 4149 Harrison discovered in 1984, was named after him as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992, he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrisons critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music and for his having advanced societys comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. He is also in number 65 in the list of 100 greatest songwriters of all time by the same magazineIn 2002, on the first anniversary of his death the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event which included performances by many of Harrisons friends and musical collaborators including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle who described Harrison as one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced was among the performers of Monty Pythons Lumberjack Song. The profits from the concert went to Harrisons charity the Material World Charitable Foundation.\nIn 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building.

He and Roger Daltrey received The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016.\n\nEarly life and education\nTownshend was born in Chiswick West London at the Chiswick Hospital Netheravon Road in the UK. He came from a musical family his father Cliff Townshend was a professional alto saxophonist in the Royal Air Forces dance band the Squadronaires and his mother Betty n\u00e9e Dennis was a singer with the Sidney Torch and Les Douglass OrchestrasThe Townshends had a volatile marriage. Both drank heavily and had fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis whom Pete later described as clinically insane. The twoyear separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middleclass Acton and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents. His neighbourhood was onethird Polish and a devout Jewish family upstairs shared their housing with them and cooking with themmany of his fathers closest friends were JewishTownshend says he did not have many friends growing up so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like Gullivers Travels and Treasure Island. He enjoyed his familys frequent excursions to the seaside and the Isle of Man. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film Rock Around the Clock sparking his fascination with American rock and rollNot long thereafter he went to see Bill Haley perform in London Townshends first concert. At the time he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician instead he wanted to become a journalistUpon passing the elevenplus exam Townshend was enrolled at Acton County Grammar School. At Acton County he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught him a couple of chords Townshend was largely selftaught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a shortlived trad jazz group the Confederates featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church and covered Acker Bilk Kenny Ball and Lonnie Donegan. However both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock n roll with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richards debut single Move It. Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the groups drummer Chris Sherwin and purchased a reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar at his mothers antique shopTownshends brothers Paul and Simon were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively. Lacking the requisite grades to attend university Pete was faced with the decision of art school music school or getting a job. He ultimately chose to study graphic design at Ealing Art College enrolling in 1961. At Ealing Townshend studied alongside future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. Townshend dropped out in 1964 to focus on music fulltime.\n\nMusical career\n1961\u20131964: the Detours\nIn late 1961, Entwistle joined the Detours a skifflerock and roll band led by Roger Daltrey. The new bass player then suggested Townshend join as an additional guitarist. In the early days of the Detours the bands repertoire consisted of instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their lineup coalesced around Roger Daltrey on rhythm guitar Townshend on lead guitar Entwistle on bass Doug Sandom on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist. Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and according to Townshend ran things the way he wanted them.Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result Townshend with Entwistles encouragement became the sole guitarist. Through Townshends mother the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce who started booking the band as a support act for bands including Screaming Lord Sutch Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers Shane Fenton and the Fentones and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. In 1963, Townshends father arranged an amateur recording of It Was You the first song his son ever wrote. The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name. Townshends roommate Richard Barnes came up with The Who and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.\n\n1964\u20131982: The Who\nNot long after the name change drummer Doug Sandom was replaced by Keith Moon who had been drumming semiprofessionally with the Beachcombers for several years. The band was soon taken on by a mod publicist named Peter Meaden who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single Im the FaceZoot Suit they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them. The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best and dropped the High Numbers name reverting to the Who. In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument. The onstage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Whos live showsWith the assistance of Lambert the Who caught the ear of American record producer Shel Talmy who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song I Cant Explain as a deliberate soundalike of the Kinks another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, I Cant Explain was the Whos first hit reaching number eight on the British charts. A followup single Anyway Anyhow Anywhere credited to both Townshend and Daltrey also reached the top 10 in the UK. However it was the release of the Whos third single My Generation in November that according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson cemented their reputation as a hardnosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissedoff adolescents at the time. The Townshendpenned single reached number two on the UK charts becoming the Whos biggest hit. The song and its famous line I hope I die before I get old was very much about trying to find a place in society Townshend stated in an interview with David FrickeTo capitalise on their recent single success the Whos debut album My Generation The Who Sings My Generation in the US was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several James Brown covers that Daltrey favoured. Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band including Pictures of Lily Substitute Im a Boy and Happy Jack. Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album which became A Quick One While Hes Away. The album was subsequently titled A Quick One and reached No. 4 in the charts upon its release in December 1966. In their stage shows Townshend developed a guitar stunt in which he would swing his right arm against the guitar strings in a style reminiscent of the vanes of a windmill. He developed this style after watching Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards warm up before a show.\nThe Who commenced their first US tour on 22 March 1967. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites though not to the extent of his bandmate Moon. He also began experimenting with LSD though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the Monterey Pop Festival on 18 June. Released in December their next album was The Who Sell Out  a concept album based on pirate radio which had been instrumental in raising the Whos popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs and the Whos biggest US single I Can See for Miles. Despite the success of I Can See for Miles which reached No. 9 on the American charts Townshend was surprised it was not an even bigger hit as he considered it the best song he had written up to that pointBy 1968, Townshend became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. He began to develop a musical piece about a deaf dumb and blind boy who would experience sensations musically. The piece would explore the tenets of Babas philosophy. The result was the rock opera Tommy released on 23 May 1969 to critical and commercial success. In support of Tommy the Who launched a tour that included a memorable appearance at the Woodstock Festival on 17 August. While the Who were playing Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman jumped the stage to complain about the arrest of John Sinclair. Townshend promptly knocked him offstage with his guitar shouting Fuck off my fucking stage!In 1970, the Who released Live at Leeds which several music critics cite as the best live album of all time. Townshend began writing material for another rock opera. Dubbed Lifehouse it was designed to be a multimedia project that symbolised the relationship between a musician and his audience. The rest of the band were confused by its convoluted plot and simply wanted another album. Townshend began to feel alienated and the project was abandoned after he suffered a nervous breakdown. Much of the material intended for Lifehouse was released as a traditional studio album Whos Next. It became a commercial smash reaching number one in the UK and spawned two successful hit singles Baba ORiley and Wont Get Fooled Again that featured pioneering use of the synthesizer. Baba ORiley in particular was written as Townshends ode to his two heroes at the time Meher Baba and composer Terry Riley.\nTownshend began writing songs for another rock opera in 1973. He decided it would explore the mod subculture and its clashes with rockers in the early 1960s in the UK. Entitled Quadrophenia it was the only Who album written entirely by Townshend and he produced the album as well due to the souring of relations with Lambert. It was released in November and became their highest charting crossAtlantic success reaching No. 2 in the UK and US. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray called it prime cut Who and the most rewarding musical experience of the year. On tour the band played the album along to prerecorded backing tapes causing much friction. The tapes malfunctioned during a performance in Newcastle prompting Townshend to drag soundman Bob Pridden onstage scream at him and kick over all the amplifiers partially destroying the malfunctioning tapes. On 14 April 1974, Townshend played his first solo concert a benefit to raise funds for a London community centreA film version of Tommy was directed by Ken Russell and starred Roger Daltrey in the title role AnnMargret as his mother and Oliver Reed as his stepfather with cameos by Tina Turner Elton John Eric Clapton and other rock notables the film premiered on 18 March 1975. Townshend was nominated for an Academy Award for scoring and adapting the music in the film. The Who by Numbers came out in November of that year and peaked at No. 7 in the UK and 8 in the US. It featured introspective songs often with a negative slant. The album spawned one hit single Squeeze Box that was written after Townshend learned how to play the accordion. After a 1976 tour Townshend took a yearlong break from the band to focus on spending time with his familyThe Who continues despite the deaths of two of the original members Keith Moon in 1978 and John Entwistle in 2002). The band is regarded by many rock critics as one of the best live bands from the 1960s to the 2000s. The Who continues to perform critically acclaimed sets into the 21st century including highly regarded performances at The Concert for New York City in 2001, the 2004 Isle of Wight Festival Live 8 in 2005, and the 2007 Glastonbury FestivalTownshend remained the primary songwriter and leader of the group writing over 100 songs which appeared on the bands eleven studio albums. Among his creations is the rock opera Quadrophenia. Townshend revisited albumlength storytelling throughout his career and remains associated with the rock opera form. Many studio recordings also feature Townshend on piano or keyboards though keyboardheavy tracks increasingly featured guest artists in the studio such as Nicky Hopkins John Bundrick or Chris StaintonTownshend is one of the key figures in the development of feedback in rock guitar. When asked who first used feedback Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said\n\nPete Townshend was definitely the first. But not being that good a guitarist he used to just sort of crash chords and let the guitar feedback. He didnt get into twiddling with the dials on the amplifier until much later. Hes overrated in England but at the same time you find a lot of people like Jeff Beck and Hendrix getting credit for things he started. Townshend was the first to break his guitar and he was the first to do a lot of things. Hes very good at his chord scene too.\nSimilarly when Jimmy Page was asked about the development of guitar feedback he saidI dont know who really did feedback first it just sort of happened. I dont think anybody consciously nicked it from anybody else. It was just going on. But Pete Townshend obviously was the one through the music of his group who made the use of feedback more his style and so its related to him. Whereas the other players like Jeff Beck and myself were playing more single note things than chords.\nMany rock guitarists have cited Townshend as an influence among them Slash Alex Lifeson and Steve Jones.\n\n1972\u2013present solo career\nIn addition to his work with the Who Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend along with other devotees to Meher Baba recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings Happy Birthday I Am and With Love. In response to bootlegging of these he compiled his personal highlights and Evolution a collaboration with Ronnie Lane and released his first majorlabel solo title 1972's Who Came First. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs as well as a showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with the Faces bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album 1977's Rough Mix. In 1979 Townshend produced and performed guitar on the novelty single Peppermint Lump by Angie on Stiff Records featuring 11-yearold Angela Porter on lead vocalsTownshend made several solo appearances during the 1970s two of which were captured on record Eric Claptons Rainbow Concert in January 1973 which Townshend organized to revive Claptons career after the latters heroin addiction and the Paul McCartneysponsored Concerts for the People of Kampuchea in December 1979. The commercially available video of the Kampuchea concert shows the two rock icons duelling and clowning through Rockestra megaband versions of Lucille Let It Be and Rockestra Theme Townshend closes the proceedings with a characteristic splitlegged leapTownshends solo breakthrough following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon was the 1980 release Empty Glass which included the top10 single Let My Love Open the Door and lesser singles A Little Is Enough and Rough Boys. This release was followed in 1982 by All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes which included the popular radio track Slit Skirts. While not a huge commercial success noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as Townshends most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia. Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats releasing several storybased albums including White City A Novel 1985) The Iron Man A Musical 1989) and Psychoderelict 1993).\nTownshend also got the chance to play with his hero Hank Marvin for Paul McCartneys Rockestra sessions along with other rock musicians such as David Gilmour John Bonham and Ronnie Lane.\nTownshend recorded several concert albums including one featuring a supergroup he assembled called Deep End with David Gilmour on guitar who performed just three concerts and a television show session for The Tube to raise money for his DoubleO charity supporting drug addicts. In 1993, he and Des McAnuff wrote and directed the Broadway adaptation of the Who album Tommy as well as a less successful stage musical based on his solo album The Iron Man based upon the book by Ted Hughes. McAnuff and Townshend later coproduced the animated film The Iron Giant also based on the Hughes story.\nA production described as a Townshend rock opera and titled The Boy Who Heard Music debuted as part of Vassar Colleges Powerhouse Summer Theater program in July 2007On 2 September 2017 in Lenox Massachusetts Townshend embarked with fellow singer and musician Billy Idol tenor Alfie Boe and an orchestra on a short 5-date Classic Quadrophenia US tour which ended on 16 September 2017 in Los Angeles California.\n\n1996\u2013present latest Who work\nFrom the mid1990s through the present Townshend has participated in a series of tours with the surviving members of the Who including a 2002 tour that continued despite Entwistles deathIn February 2006, a major world tour by the Who was announced to promote their first new album since 1982. Townshend published a semiautobiographical story The Boy Who Heard Music as a serial on a blog beginning in September 2005. The blog closed in October 2006, as noted on Townshends website. It is now owned by a different user and does not relate to Townshends work in any way. On 25 February 2006, he announced the issue of a miniopera inspired by the novella for June 2006. In October 2006 the Who released their first album in 24 years Endless Wire.\nThe Who performed at the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show on 7 February 2010, playing a medley of songs that included Pinball Wizard Who Are You Baba ORiley See Me Feel Me and Wont Get Fooled Again. In 2012, the Who announced they would tour the rock opera Quadrophenia.\nThe Who were the final performers at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London performing a medley of Baba ORiley See Me Feel Me and My Generation.On 22 March 2018, Townshend stated that a new Who album should feature original songs by Roger Daltrey as well as him. That album simply titled Who was released on 6 December 2019. It was the bands second album as a duo and their first in thirteen years.\n\nUnfinished work\nThe Age of Anxiety formerly Floss the Musical is the name given to a workinprogress by Townshend. The musical has been a work in progress at least since 2009 with an original estimated release of 2011. On 24 January 2012 Townshend sold the rights to all of his back catalog and much of his future work including Floss The Musical if it is ever completed. He summarized the work in an interview with Sirius Satellite Radio published February 2010. In a 2015 interview Townshend stated that the work was intended to be an art installation. In March 2019 it was announced that a work entitled The Age of Anxiety would be published as a novel with an opera to follow.\n\nMusical influences\nTownshend was born ten days after Nazi Germany surrendered in the Second World War and grew up in the shadow of reconstruction in and around London. According to Townshend postwar trauma was the driving force behind the rock music revolution in the UK. Trauma is passed from generation to generation he said Ive unwittingly inherited what my father experienced. Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life. In his autobiography he wrote I wasnt trying to play beautiful music. I was confronting my audience with the awful visceral sound of what we all knew was the single absolute of our frail existenceone day an aeroplane would carry the bomb that would destroy us all in a flash. It could happen at any time.\nAlthough he grew up in a household with jazz musicians Townshend absorbed many of his ideas about performance and rock music themes during art school. Townshends roommate at Ealing Art College Tom Wright had a large record collection and Townshend listened to and became influenced by RB and rock  roll artists like Howlin Wolf John Lee Hooker Bo Diddley Booker T.  the MGs Little Walter and Chuck Berry. He was also strongly influenced by cellist Malcolm Cecil who often damaged his cello during performances along with Gustav Metzger pioneer of autodestructive art. In light of these influences guitar smashing became not just an expression of youthful angst but also a means of conveying ideas through musical performance. We advanced a new concept he writes. Destruction is art when set to music. Townshend also cited Robbie Basho as a significant influence saying Ive totally been influenced by him. You can hear it in my work.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nThroughout his solo career and his career with the Who Townshend has played a large variety of guitars  mostly various Fender Gibson and Rickenbacker models. He has also used Guild Takamine and Gibson J200 acoustic models with the J200 providing his signature recorded acoustic sound in such songs as Pinball Wizard.In the early days with the Who Townshend played an Emile Grimshaw SS De Luxe and 6-string and 12-string Rickenbacker semihollow electric guitars primarily particularly the RoseMorris UKimported models with special fholes. When the excited audience responded enthusiastically after he accidentally broke the head off his guitar on a low ceiling during a concert at the Railway Hotel pub in Wealdstone west London he incorporated the eventual smashing of his instrument into the bands performances. However as instrumentsmashing became increasingly integrated into the Whos concert sets he switched to more durable and resilient and importantly cheaper guitars for smashing such as the Fender Stratocaster Fender Telecaster and various Danelectro models. On the Whos The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour appearance in 1967, Townshend used a Vox Cheetah guitar which he only used for that performance the guitar was destroyed by Townshend and Moons drum explosion. In the late 1960s Townshend began playing Gibson SG Special models almost exclusively. He used this guitar at the Woodstock and Isle of Wight shows in 1969 and 1970, as well as the Live at Leeds performance in 1970.\nBy 1970 Gibson changed the design of the SG Special which Townshend had been using previously and he began using other guitars. For much of the 1970s he used a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe some with only two minihumbucker pickups and others modified with a third pickup in the middle position a DiMarzio Superdistortion  Dual Sound. He can be seen using several of these guitars in the documentary The Kids Are Alright although in the studio he often played a 59 Gretsch 6120 guitar given to him by Joe Walsh most notably on the albums Whos Next and QuadropheniaDuring the 1980s Townshend mainly used Fenders Rickenbackers and Telecasterstyle models built for him by Schecter and various other luthiers. Since the late1980s Townshend has used the Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster with Lace Sensor pickups both in the studio and on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pickup system to simulate acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra volume control behind the guitars bridge.\nDuring the Whos 1989 Tour Townshend played a Rickenbacker guitar that was ironically smashed accidentally when he tripped over it. Instead of throwing the smashed parts away Townshend reassembled the pieces as a sculpture. The sculpture was featured at the Rock Stars Cars And Guitars 2 exhibit during the summer of 2009 at The Henry Ford museum.\n\nThere are several Gibson Pete Townshend signature guitars such as the Pete Townshend SG the Pete Townshend J200, and three different Pete Townshend Les Paul Deluxes. The SG was clearly marked as a Pete Townshend limited edition model and came with a special case and certificate of authenticity signed by Townshend himself. There has also been a Pete Townshend signature Rickenbacker limited edition guitar of the model 1998, which was his main 6-string guitar in the Whos early days. The run featured 250 guitars which were made between July 1987  March 1988, and according to Rickenbacker CEO John Hall the entire run sold out before serious advertising could be done.\nHe also used the Gibson ES335, one of which he donated to the Hard Rock Cafe. Townshend also used a Gibson EDS1275 doubleneck very briefly circa late 1967, and both a Harmony Sovereign H1270 and a Fender Electric XII for the studio sessions for Tommy for the 12-string guitar parts. He also occasionally used Fender Jazzmasters on stage in 1967 and 1968 and in the studio for Tommy.\n\nAmps\nOver the years Townshend has used many types of amplifier including Vox Selmer Fender Marshall and Hiwatt sticking to using Hiwatt amps for most of four decades. Around the time of Whos Next he used a tweed Fender Bandmaster amp also given to him by Joe Walsh in 1970) which he also used for Quadrophenia and The Who by Numbers. While recording Face Dances and the collaborative album Rough Mix Townshend made use of a Peavey Vintage 4\u00d710 amplifier in the studio. Since 1989, his rig consisted of four Fender VibroKing stacks and a Hiwatt head driving two custom made 2\u00d712\" HiwattMesa Boogie speaker cabinets. However since 2006, he has only three VibroKing stacks one of which is a backup.\nTownshend figured prominently in the development of what is widely known in rock circles as the Marshall stack. He ordered several speaker cabinets that contained eight 12\" speakers in a housing standing nearly six feet in height with the top half of the cabinet slanted slightly upward. These were too heavy to move easily so Jim Marshall cut the massive speaker cabinet in half at the suggestion of Townshend with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.\nHe has always regarded his instruments as being merely tools of the trade and has in latter years kept his most prized instruments well away from the concert stage. These instruments include a few vintage and reissue Rickenbackers the Gretsch 6120, an original 1952 Fender Telecaster Gibson Custom Shops artist limited edition reissues of Townshends Les Paul DeLuxe models 1, 3 and 9 as well his signature SG Special reissue.\n\nKeyboards\nTownshend played keyboards on several Who songs. On Whos Next he began to work with analogue synthesizers using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He had this to say about the instrument I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that arent in my hands the sound of an orchestra French horns strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar youre stuck with as fast as you can play and I dont play fast I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth.The synths Townshend was referring to included the EMS VCS3 and ARP 2600, some of which modified a Lowrey TBO Berkshire organ. Current photos of his home studio also show an ARP 2500. Townshend was featured in ARP promotional materials in the early 1970sSince the late 1980s Townshend has predominantly used Synclavier Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition particularly solo albums and projects. He currently owns three systems one large Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio system originally installed in his riverside Oceanic Studio later transferred to a seagoing barge moored alongside the studio on the River Thames and currently based in his home studio. He also uses a special adapted smaller Synclavier 3200 system which can be transported enabling him to carry on working away from his main studio. This 3200 system was modified to be of similar specification to the 9600, including the addition internally of FM voices stereo Poly voices and with the large VPK keyboard. This is the only Synclavier 3200 system of this specification in existence customdesigned and built for Townshend by Steve Hills. The third system Townshend owns is one of the first Synclavier II systems ever built. The ORK original smaller keyboard of which is on display in his companys head office alongside a pink Vespa scooter.\n\nLiterary work\nAlthough known for his musical compositions and musicianship Townshend has been extensively involved in the literary world for more than three decades writing newspaper and magazine articles book reviews essays books and scripts.\nAn early example of Townshends writing came in August 1970 with the first of nine installments of The Pete Townshend Page a monthly column written by Townshend for the British music paper Melody Maker. The column provided Townshends perspective on an array of subjects such as the media and the state of US concert halls and public address systems as well as providing valuable insight into Townshends mindset during the evolution of his Lifehouse project.\nTownshend also wrote three sizeable essays for Rolling Stone magazine the first of which appeared in November 1970. In Love With Meher Baba described Townshends spiritual leanings. Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy a blowbyblow account of the Who compilation album of the same name followed in December 1971. The third article The Punk Meets the Godmother appeared in November 1977.\nAlso in 1977, Townshend founded Eel Pie Publishing which specialised in childrens titles music books and several Meher Babarelated publications. He also opened a bookstore named Magic Bus after the popular Who song in London. The Story of Tommy a book written by Townshend and his art school friend Richard Barnes now the Whos official biographer about the writing of Townshends 1969 rock opera and the making of the 1975 Ken Russelldirected film was published by Eel Pie the same year.\nIn July 1983, Townshend took a position as an acquisitions editor for London publisher Faber and Faber. Notable projects included editing Animals frontman Eric Burdons autobiography Charles Shaar Murrays awardwinning Crosstown Traffic Jimi Hendrix and PostWar Pop Brian Eno and Russell Millss More Dark Than Shark and working with Prince Charles on a volume of his collected speeches. Townshend commissioned Dave Rimmers Like Punk Never Happened and was commissioning editor for radical playwright Steven Berkoff.\nTwo years after joining Faber and Faber Townshend decided to publish a book of his own. Horses Neck issued in May 1985, was a collection of short stories hed written between 1979 and 1984, tackling subjects such as childhood stardom and spirituality. As a result of his position with Faber and Faber Townshend developed friendships with both Nobel prizewinning author of Lord of the Flies Sir William Golding and British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes. His friendship with Hughes led to Townshends musical interpretation of Hughess childrens story The Iron Man six years later as The Iron Man The Musical by Pete Townshend released in 1989.\nTownshend has written several scripts spanning the breadth of his career including numerous drafts of his elusive Lifehouse project the last of which cowritten with radio playwright Jeff Young was published in 1999. In 1978, Townshend wrote a script for Fish Shop a play commissioned but not completed by London Weekend Television and in mid1984 he wrote a script for White City A Novel which led to a short film.\nIn 1989 Townshend began work on a novel entitled Ray High  The Glass Household a draft of which was later submitted to his editor. While the original novel remains unpublished elements from this story were used in Townshends 1993 solo album Psychoderelict. In 1993, Townshend authored another book The Whos Tommy a chronicle of the development of the awardwinning Broadway version of his rock opera.\nThe opening of his personal website and his commerce site Eelpiecom both in 2000, gave Townshend another outlet for literary work. Eelpiecom was closed down in 2010 Several of Townshends essays have been posted online including Meher BabaThe Silent Master My Own Silence in 2001, and A Different Bomb an indictment of the child pornography industry the following year.\nIn September 2005, Townshend began posting a novella online entitled The Boy Who Heard Music as background for a musical of the same name. He posted a chapter each week until it was completed and novella was available to read at his website for several months. Like Psychoderelict it was yet another extrapolation of Lifehouse and Ray High  The Glass Household.\nIn 1997 Townshend signed a deal with Little Brown and Company publishing to write his autobiography reportedly titled Pete Townshend Who He? Townshends creative vagaries and conceptual machinations have been chronicled by Larry David Smith in his book The Minstrels Dilemma Praeger 1999). After a lengthy delay Townshends autobiography now titled Who I Am was released 8 October 2012. The book ranked in the top 5 of The New York Times best seller list in October 2012On 5 March 2019, Townshend announced that his debut novel titled The Age of Anxiety would be published on 5 November 2019 by Hodder  Stoughton imprint Coronet. Townshend called the work an extended meditation on manic genius and the dark art of creativity. The novel will be accompanied by an opera which is currently in development with an art installation to follow.\n\nSpirituality\nIn 1967 Townshend had begun to explore spirituality. Townshend swiftly absorbed all of Meher Babas writings that he could find by April 1968, he announced himself Babas disciple. At about this time Townshend who had been searching the past two years for a basis for a rock opera created a story inspired by the teachings of Baba and other writings and expressing the enlightenment he believed that he had received from them which ultimately became TommyIn interviews Townshend was more open about his beliefs penning an article on Baba for Rolling Stone magazine in 1970 and stating that following Babas teachings he was opposed to the use of all psychedelic drugs making him one of the first rock stars with counterculture credibility to turn against their use. This did not prevent him from later indulging in substance abuse. He wrote in Who I Am of becoming addicted to cocaine in 1980-1981, to the point of overdosing and needing resuscitation. He also wrote that by January 1982, I needed help to break my dependence on prescription drugs and heroin.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships\nTownshend met Karen Astley daughter of film composer Edwin Astley while in art school. They married on 20 May 1968 and moved into a threebedroom townhouse in Twickenham in outer southwest London that overlooked the Thames. They have three children Emma born 1969) who is a gardening columnist Aminta born 1971) who works in film production and Joseph born 1989) who studied graphic design at Central St. MartinsTownshend and his wife separated in 1994. He has since been in a romantic relationship with arranger and musician Rachel Fuller whom he secretly married in 2016. Townshend lived at The Wick Richmond London England but sold the house in August 2021 for more than 15 million. He also owns a house in Churt Surrey and in 2010 purchased a lease of part of the National Trust property Ashdown House in Oxfordshire. According to The Sunday Times Rich List his assets were worth 40 million as of 2009.\n\nSexuality\nIn a 1989 interview with radio host Timothy White Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality referencing the song Rough Boys on his 1980 studio album Empty Glass. He called the song a coming out an acknowledgment of the fact that Id had a gay life and that I understood what gay sex was about. However in a 1994 interview for Playboy he said I did an interview about it saying that Rough Boys was about being gay and in the interview I also talked about my gay life whichI meantwas actually about the friends Ive had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the ts and crossed the is and assumed that this was a coming out which it wasnt at all. Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he is probably bisexual. Townshend also stated that he once felt sexually attracted to the Rolling Stones lead vocalist Mick Jagger.\n\nLegal issues\nTownshend accepted a caution from the Metropolitan Police the Met as part of Operation Ore a major investigation on child sexual abuse images conducted in 2002\u20132003. The Met stated that it was established that Mr Townshend was not in possession of any downloaded child abuse images. Townshend was on a sex offenders register for five years beginning in 2003, after admitting he had used his credit card to access a child sexual abuse images website. Townshend claimed he accessed the images as research in a campaign against child sexual abuse  specifically to prove that British banks were complicit in channelling the profits from paedophile rings. Authorities could not prove that the website accessed by Townshend involved children and no incriminating evidence was found on his personal computer.\n\nHearing loss\nTownshend suffers from partial deafness and tinnitus likely the result of noiseinduced hearing loss from his extensive exposure to loud music. The Who were renowned as a very loud band in their live performances some particular incidents include a Who concert at the Charlton Athletic Football Club London on 31 May 1976 that was listed as the Loudest Concert Ever by the Guinness Book of Records where the volume level was measured at 126 decibels 32 metres from the stage. Townshend has also attributed the start of his hearing loss to Keith Moons famous exploding drum set during the Whos 1967 appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy HourIn 1989, Townshend gave the initial funding to allow the formation of the nonprofit hearing advocacy group HEAR. Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers. After the Who performed at halftime at Super Bowl XLIV Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told Rolling Stone If my hearing is going to be a problem were not delaying shows. Were finished. I cant really see any way around the issue. Neil Young introduced him to an audiologist who suggested he use an inear monitor and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the WhoIn March 2011, Roger Daltrey said in an interview with the BBC that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but severe hearing loss and was now trying to save what remained of his hearing Petes having terrible trouble with his hearing. Hes got really really bad problems with it..not tinnitus its deterioration and hes seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing.\nReferring to that in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog My hearing is actually better than ever because after a feedback scare at the indigO2 in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies that are out of my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for TCT at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010. Im 66, I dont have perfect hearing and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1998, Townshend was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the UK Labour Party. He refused to let Michael Moore use Wont Get Fooled Again in Fahrenheit 9/11 2004) saying that he watched Bowling for Columbine 2002) and was not convinced. In 1961 while in art school Townshend joined the Young Communist League and was a prominent figure in their 1966 Trend recruitment campaign. In a 1974 Penthouse interview he stated that he recognised in practice he was a capitalist who was rewarded well for his work but that his ideals were communistIn a widely reported 2012 interview with ABC Townshend described himself jokingly as being a bit of a neocon stating that I like the idea of America as the worlds police force. Then we dont have to do it. You guys sort it out.In a 2019 interview with The Times Townshend revealed he was in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union stating Im a Remainer he Roger Daltrey is a Brexiteer. I believe in God he doesnt.\n\nCharity work\nTownshend has woven a long history of involvement with various charities and other philanthropic efforts throughout his career both as a solo artist and with the Who. His first solo concert for example was a 1974 benefit show which was organised to raise funds for the Camden Square Community Play Centre.\nThe earliest public example of Townshends involvement with charitable causes was in 1968, when Townshend donated the use of his former Wardour Street apartment to the Meher Baba Association. The following year the association was moved to another Townshendowned apartment the Eccleston Square former residence of his wife Karen. Townshend sat on a committee which oversaw the operation and finances of the centre. The committee sees to it that it is open a couple of days a week and keeps the bills paid and the library full he wrote in a 1970 Rolling Stone articleIn 1969 and 1972, Townshend produced two limitedrelease albums Happy Birthday and I Am for the Londonbased Baba association. This led to 1972's Who Came First a more widespread release 15 per cent of the revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release With Love was released in 1976. A limitededition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD Avatar was released in 2000, with all profits going to the Avatar Meher Baba Trust in India which provided funds to a dispensary school hospital and pilgrimage centre.\nIn July 1976, Townshend opened Meher Baba Oceanic a London activity centre for Baba followers which featured film dubbing and editing facilities a cinema and a recording studio. In addition the centre served as a regular meeting place for Baba followers. Townshend offered very economical reportedly 1 per night lodging for American followers who needed an overnight stay on their pilgrimages to India. Townshend wrote in a 1977 Rolling Stone article For a few years I had toyed with the idea of opening a London house dedicated to Meher Baba. In the eight years I had followed him I had donated only coppers to foundations set up around the world to carry out the Masters wishes and decided it was about time I put myself on the line. The Who had set up a strong charitable trust of its own which appeased to an extent the feeling I had that Meher Baba would rather have seen me give to the poor than to the establishment of yet another socalled spiritual center. Townshend also embarked on a project dedicated to the collection restoration and maintenance of Meher Babarelated films. The project was known as MEFA or Meher Baba European Film Archive.\n\nChildrens charities\nTownshend has been an active champion of childrens charities. The debut of Townshends stage version of Tommy took place at San Diegos La Jolla Playhouse in July 1992. The show was earmarked as a benefit for the Londonbased NordoffRobbins Music Therapy Foundation an organisation which helps children with autism and intellectual disabilityTownshend performed at a 1995 benefit organised by Paul Simon at Madison Square Gardens Paramount Theatre for the Childrens Health Fund. The following year Townshend performed at a benefit for the annual Bridge School Benefit a California facility for children with severe speech and physical impairments with concerts organised by Neil and Pegi Young. In 1997, Townshend established a relationship with Maryville Academy a Chicago area childrens charity. Between 1997 and 2002, Townshend played five benefit shows for Maryville Academy raising at least 1,600,000. His 1998 album A Benefit for Maryville Academy was made to support their activities and proceeds from the sales of his release were donated to themAs a member of the Who Townshend has also performed a series of concerts beginning in 2000 to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK which raised several million pounds. In 2005, Townshend performed at New Yorks Gotham Hall for Samsungs Four Seasons of Hope an annual childrens charity fundraiser. In the same year he donated a smashed guitar to the Pediatric Epilepsy ProjectOn 4 November 2011, Roger Daltrey and Townshend launched the DaltreyTownshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to be funded by the Whos charity Who Cares. The launch followed on 5 November by a fundraising event was also attended by Robert Plant and Dave GrohlIn 2024, Townshend contributed guitar to a rerelease of Mark Knopflers Going Home Theme of the Local Hero in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDrug rehabilitation\nTownshend has also advocated for drug rehabilitation. In a 1985 radio interview he said\n\nWhat Im most active in doing is raising money to provide beds in clinics to help people that have become victims of drug abuse. In Britain the facilities are very very very lean indeed ... although we have a national health service a free medical system it does nothing particularly for class A drug addicts  cocaine abusers heroin abusers ... were making a lot of progress ... the British government embarked on an antiheroin campaign with advertising and I was coopted by them as a kind of figurehead and then the various other people coopted me into their own campaigns but my main work is raising money to try and open a large clinicThe large clinic Townshend was referring to was a drug treatment facility in London that he and drug rehabilitation experimenter Meg Patterson had devised but the plan failed to come to fruition. Two early 1979 concerts by the Who raised 20,000 for Pattersons Pharmakon Clinic in SussexFurther examples of Townshends drug rehabilitation activism took place in the form of a 1984 benefit concert incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band the Stone Roses an article he wrote a few days later for Britains Mail on Sunday urging better care for the nations growing number of drug addicts and the formation of a charitable organisation DoubleO Charities to raise funds for the causes hed recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fundraising antiheroin Tshirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshends 1985\u201386 band Deep End played two benefits at Brixton Academy in 1985 for DoubleO Charities.\n\nAmnesty International\nIn 1979 Townshend donated his services to the human rights organisation Amnesty International when he performed three songs for its benefit show The Secret Policemans Ball  performances that were released on record and seen in the film of the show. Townshends acoustic performances of three of his songs Pinball Wizard Drowned and Wont Get Fooled Again were subsequently cited as forerunners and inspiration for the unplugged phenomenon in the 1990sTownshend had been invited to perform for Amnesty by Martin Lewis the producer of The Secret Policemans Ball who stated later that Townshends participation had been the key to his securing the subsequent participation for Amnesty in the 1981 sequel show of Sting Eric Clapton Jeff Beck Phil Collins and Bob Geldof. Other performers inspired to support Amnesty International in future Secret Policemans Ball shows and other benefits because of Townshends early commitment to the organisation include Peter Gabriel Bruce Springsteen David Gilmour and U2's lead singer Bono who in 1986 told Rolling Stone magazine I saw The Secret Policemans Ball and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...\n\nDiscography\nSolo albums\nWho Came First 1972)\nRough Mix 1977) with Ronnie Lane\nEmpty Glass 1980)\nAll the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes 1982)\nWhite City A Novel 1985)\nThe Iron Man The Musical by Pete Townshend 1989)\nPsychoderelict 1993)Townshend also released several albums dedicated to his spiritual mentor Meher Baba listed on the discography page.\n\nGuest appearances\nIn 1968 Townshend helped assemble a band called Thunderclap Newman consisting of three musicians he knew pianist Andy Newman an old art school friend drummer John Speedy Keen who had written Armenia City in the Sky for the Who to record for their 1967 studio album The Who Sell Out and teenage guitarist Jimmy McCulloch later to join Wings. Townshend produced the band and played bass on their recordings under the tongueincheek pseudonym Bijou Drains. Their first recording was the single Something in the Air which became a number one hit in the UK and a substantial hit elsewhere in the world. Following this success Townshend produced their sole album Hollywood DreamIn 1971 Townshend along with Keith Moon and Ronnie Lane backed Mike Heron of the Incredible String Band on one song Warm Heart Pastry from Herons first solo LP Smiling Men with Bad Reputations. On the album notes they are listed as Tommy and the Bijoux.\nIn 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to the track Im the Answer on his brother Simons debut solo album Sweet Sound.\nTownshend shares songwriting credit on two songs Love on the Air and All Lovers Are Deranged on Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmours 1984 solo album About FaceThrough much of 2005, Townshend recorded and performed alongside his girlfriend Rachel Fuller a classically trained pianist and singersongwriterIn 2006 Townshend opened a website for implementation of The Lifehouse Method based on his 1971 Lifehouse concept.

Many professional classical guitarists were either students of Segovia or students of Segovias students.\nSegovias contribution to the modernromantic repertoire included not only commissions but also his own transcriptions of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive performances his wide palette of tone and his distinctive musical personality phrasing and style.\n\nEarly life\nSegovia was born on 21 February 1893 in Linares Ja\u00e9n. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle Eduardo and aunt Mar\u00eda. Eduardo arranged for Segovias first music lessons with a violin teacher after he had recognised that Segovia had an aptitude for music. That proved to be an unhappy introduction to music for the young Segovia because of the teachers strict methods and Eduardo stopped the lessons. His uncle decided to move to Granada to allow Segovia to obtain a better education. After arriving in Granada Segovia recommenced his musical studies. Segovia was aware of flamenco during his formative years as a musician but stated that he did not have a taste for the form and chose instead the works of Fernando Sor Francisco T\u00e1rrega and other classical composers. T\u00e1rrega agreed to give the selftaught Segovia some lessons but died before they could meet and Segovia states that his early musical education involved the double function of professor and pupil in the same body.\n\nCareer\nSegovias first public performance was in Granada at the age of 16 in 1909. A few years later he played his first professional concert in Madrid which included works by Francisco T\u00e1rrega and his own guitar transcriptions of Johann Sebastian Bach. Despite the discouragement of his family who wanted him to become a lawyer and criticism by some of T\u00e1rregas pupils for his idiosyncratic technique he continued to pursue his studies of the guitar diligently.\nHe played again in Madrid in 1912, at the Paris Conservatory in 1915 and in Barcelona in 1916 and made a successful tour of South America in 1919. Segovias arrival on the international stage coincided with a time when the guitars fortunes as a concert instrument were being revived largely through the efforts of Miguel Llobet. It was in that changing milieu that Segovia thanks to his strength of personality and artistry coupled with developments in recording and broadcasting succeeded in making the guitar more popular again.\nIn 1921 in Paris Segovia met Alexandre Tansman who later wrote a number of guitar works for Segovia among them Cavatina which won a prize at the Siena International Composition contest in 1952. In 1921, he also met Agust\u00edn Barrios in Buenos Aires Argentina. Segovia was impressed by Barrios Bachinspired and arguably magnum opus La CatedralAt Granada in 1922, he became associated with the Concurso de Cante Jondo promoted by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The aim of the classicising Concurso was to preserve flamenco in its purity from being distorted by modern popular music. Segovia had already developed as a fine tocador of flamenco guitar yet his direction was now classical. Invited to open the Concurso held at the Alhambra he played Homenaje a Debussy by Falla.\nIn 1923, Segovia visited Mexico for the first time. There Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in El Universal. Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia including numerous sonatas.\nIn 1924, Segovia visited the German luthier Hermann Hauser Sr. after Segovia heard some of Hausers instruments played in a concert in Munich. In 1928, Hauser provided Segovia with one of the guitars which Segovia used during his tour of the United States and in other concerts up to 1933. Segovia ordered a further guitar from Hauser and after receiving it passed on the 1928 model to his American representative and close friend Sophocles Papas who in his turn gave it to his student the famous jazz and classical guitarist Charlie Byrd who used it on several records.\nSegovias first American tour was arranged in 1928 when Fritz Kreisler the Viennese violinist who privately played the guitar persuaded Francis Charles Coppicus from the Metropolitan Musical Bureau to present the guitarist in New YorkAfter Segovias debut tour in the US in 1928 the Brazilian composer Heitor VillaLobos composed his now wellknown Twelve \u00c9tudes Portuguese Doze estudos French Douze \u00e9tudes German Zw\u00f6lf Studien and later dedicated them to Segovia. Their relationship proved to be lasting and VillaLobos continued to write for Segovia. He also transcribed numerous classical pieces himself and revived the pieces transcribed by predecessors like T\u00e1rrega.\n\nIn 1932, Segovia met and befriended the composer Mario CastelnuovoTedesco in Venice. Since CastelnuovoTedesco did not play the guitar Segovia provided him with guitar compositions Ponces Folias variations and Sors Mozart Variations which he could study. CastelnuovoTedesco composed a large number of works for the guitar many of them dedicated to Segovia. The Concerto Op. 99 of 1939 was the first guitar concerto of the 20th century and CastelnuovoTedescos last work in Italy before he emigrated to the United States. It was premiered by Segovia in Uruguay in 1939In 1935, he gave his first public performance of Bachs Chaconne a difficult piece for any instrument. He moved to Montevideo and performed many concerts in South America in the 1930s and the early 1940s.\nAfter World War II Segovia began to record more frequently and performed regular tours of Europe and America and would maintain that schedule for 30 years. In 1954, Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo dedicated Fantas\u00eda para un gentilhombre Fantasy for a Gentleman to Segovia. Segovia won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance Instrumentalist for his recording Segovia Golden JubileeJohn W. Duarte dedicated his English Suite Op. 31 to Segovia and his wife Emilia Magdalena del Corral Sancho on the occasion of their marriage in 1962. Segovia told the composer You will be astonished at the success it will have.In recognition of his contributions to music and the arts Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981 by King Juan Carlos I who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marqu\u00e9s de Salobre\u00f1a English Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a in the nobility of Spain.\nSegovia continued performing into his old age and lived in semiretirement during his seventies and eighties on the Costa del Sol. Two films were made of his life and work one when he was 75 and the other when he was 84. They are available on DVD under the titles Andr\u00e9s Segoviain Portrait. His final RCA LP ARL1-1602) Reveries was recorded in Madrid in June 1977.\nIn 1984, Segovia was the subject of a 13-part series broadcast on National Public Radio Segovia! The series was recorded on location in Spain France and the United States. Hosted by Oscar Brand the series was produced by Jim Anderson Robert Malesky and Larry Snitzler.\nSegovia died on 2 June 1987 in Madrid of a heart attack at the age of 94. He is buried at Casa Museo Andr\u00e9s Segovia in Linares.\n\nTechnique\nThe right hand is responsible for the guitars musical sound and so in examining the technique the way the right hand is placed in relation to the strings is most important. For several years it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of fingertip and nail as stated by Christopher Parkening but Segovia plucked the strings only with the nails. When asked which technique he used he replied that it was the only one there is nails. Because they bring timbre differences and colour variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar. His right hand was placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings. That way the nail alone would press the string. At the same time it was thought that was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings E A and D of the guitar when they were  plucked.\nSegovia created a strong bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique largely because of the flexibility that he had in his thumb which helped to create a very strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes.\nAnother innovation that separated Segovia from the T\u00e1rrega school was the search for the tension in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side. That way he could obtain colour variation but also an especially strong round and voluminous sound which was very helpful for giving concerts in big halls the technique was later used by Narciso Yepes. Before Segovia guitarists from the T\u00e1rrega school played the guitar with the hand right over the soundhole and thus created a mellow sound but could not fill the whole space of a large concert hall.\nAfter World War II Segovia became among the first to endorse nylon strings instead of catgut strings. That advancement allowed for greater tonal stability and was the final ingredient in the standardization of the instrument.\n\nRepertoire\nSegovias repertoire consisted of three principal pillars first contemporary works including concertos and sonatas usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships notably Federico Moreno Torroba Federico Mompou and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce the Italian composer Mario CastelnuovoTedesco and the great Brazilian composer Heitor VillaLobos second transcriptions usually made by Segovia himself of classical works originally written for other instruments eg lute harpsichord piano violin cello by Johann Sebastian Bach Isaac Alb\u00e9niz Enrique Granados and many other prominent composers third traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco T\u00e1rrega. Segovias influence enlarged the repertoire mainly as a commissioner or dedicatee of new works as a transcriber and as a composer with such works as his Estudio sin luz.\n\nSegovias main musical aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century and turn of the century especially in the Spanish romanticmodern and nationalist style. That is perhaps best typified by Segovias own work Estudio sin Luz. Many works of that and similar styles were written especially for him and formed part of his core repertoire particularly the guitar works of Federico Moreno Torroba 1891\u20131982) such as the Sonatina which was first performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925Segovia was selective and performed only works with which he identified personally. He was known to reject atonal works or those that he considered too radical even if they were dedicated to him he rejected Frank Martins Quatre pi\u00e8ces br\u00e8ves Darius Milhauds Segoviana etc. Even though rejected by Segovia all of those works are today published and available.\n\nTeaching\nSegovia viewed teaching as vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at M\u00fasica en Compostela in the Spanish city of Santiago de CompostelaSegovia also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for numerous years where he was aided by Alirio D\u00edaz. Later it was Oscar Ghiglia who continued the Siena classHis teaching style is a source of controversy among some of his former students who considered it to be dogmatically authoritarian. One of Segovias most celebrated former students of the classical guitar John Williams has said that Segovia bullied students into playing only his style and stifled the development of their own styles. Williams has also said that Segovia was dismissive of music that did not have what Segovia considered the correct classical origins such as South American music with popular roots. He was also critical of Williams work with the group Sky for the same reasons.\n\nLegacy\nSegovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. Federico Moreno Torroba said The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andr\u00e9s Segovia. He can be credited to have dignified the classical guitar as a legitimate concert instrument before the discerning music public which had hitherto viewed the guitar merely as a limited if sonorous parlour instrument.\nIn Linares the Segovia Museum Fundaci\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Segovia was established in May 1995, and Linares Segovias birthplace also has a bronze statue in his honour created by Julio L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez and unveiled on 25 May 1984Segovia influenced a generation of classical guitarists who built on his technique and musical sensibility including Christopher Parkening Julian Bream John Williams and Oscar Ghiglia all of whom have acknowledged their debt to him. Further Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar including several transcriptions of Bach particularly an extraordinarilydemanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin BWV 1004). During his lifetime guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia who suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed. He once said All over the world I have pupils I have never met.His editions of works originally written for guitar include newlyfingered and occasionallyrevised versions of works from the standard repertoire most famously his edition of a selection of twenty estudios by Fernando Sor the cornerstone of every serious students technique since its publication in 1945 although somewhat ironically Segovia in the preface to that work disparaged Sor as not among the vigorous talents as well as compositions written for him including by Heitor VillaLobos Federico Mompou and Mario CastelnuovoTedesco. Many of the latter had been edited by Segovia working in collaboration with the composer before they were first published. Because of Segovias predilection for altering the musical content of his editions to reflect his interpretive preferences many of todays guitarists prefer to examine the original manuscripts or newer publications based on the original manuscripts to compare them with Segovias published versions to accept or reject Segovias editorial decisionsSegovia was one of those to whom homage was paid in the 1978 song by Ian Dury and The Blockheads There Aint Half Been Some Clever Bastards.\nInfluential rock entertainer Johnny Thunders included a guitar instrumental titled Illegitimate Son of Segovia in his album Hurt me.\n\nNamings\nThe mainbelt asteroid 3822 Segovia was named in his memory in 1989.\nA competition cosponsored by the European Guitar Teachers Association is named after Segovia.\n\nAwards\nSegovia was awarded many prizes and honours including doctorates honoris causa from ten universities. On 24 June 1981, he was ennobled by King Juan Carlos I who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marqu\u00e9s de Salobre\u00f1a English Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a in the nobility of Spain in recognition of his contributions to music and the arts. He received the Danish Sonning Award in 1974, the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1985, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986.\n\nPersonal life\nSegovias first wife was Adelaida Portillo marriage in 1918). Segovias second wife marriage in 1935) was the pianist Paquita Madriguera who also made some piano roll recordings. From 1944, he maintained a romantic relationship with Brazilian singer and guitarist Olga Praguer Coelho which was to last for over a decade. In 1962 Segovia married Emilia Magdalena Corral Sancho. They had one son Carlos Andr\u00e9s Segovia the current Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a.\n\nPartial discography\nGuitar Solos  Decca 1949.\nAn Evening With Andres Segovia  Decca 1954 Grammy Hall of Fame Award 1999).\nGolden Jubilee 2 volumi  Brunswick 1958\u201360 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra 1958).\nIngterpreta Granados Alb\u00e9niz Scarlatti Paganini  Deutsche Grammophon 1961.\nSegovia plays Bach  Saga 1969.\nCastles of Spain  Decca 1970.\nEl arte de Andr\u00e9s Segovia  MCA 1970.\nFantasia para un Gentilhombre  MCA 1972.\nRecital intimo  Intercord 1975.\nThe Segovia Collection 9 volumi  MCA 1989\u201391\nVol. 1: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia in an AllBach Program\nVol. 2: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia plays Fantasia para un Gentilhombre Concierto del Sur Castles of Spain\nVol. 3: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia my Favorite Works\nVol. 4: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia The Baroque Guitar\nVol. 5: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia five centuries of the Spanish Guitar\nVol. 6: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia Ponce sonatas\nVol. 7: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia Guitar etudes\nVol. 8: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia Mario CastelnuovoTedesco\nVol. 9: The Legendary Andr\u00e9s Segovia The Romantic  Guitar\nThe complete 1949 London Recordings  Testament 1994.\nThe complete Early Recordings 1927\u20131939)  Fono Enterprise 1997.\nThe Art of Segovia  Deutsche Grammophon 2002.\nThe Segovia Collection 4 volumi  Deutsche Grammophon 2003.\nVol. 1: Rodrigo Boccherini Ponce\nVol. 2: Rodrigo Ponce CastelnuovoTedesco Torroba Mompou\nVol. 3: Albeniz Granados Sanz Sor\nVol. 4: Johann Sebastian Bach\nAndres Segovia 1950s American Recordings  Naxos 2007.\nPonce Concierto del Sur.

Idol has stated that the subject was one that he hated and in which he underachieved. In an interview on 21 November 1983, Idol said the name Billy Idol was a bit of a goof but part of the old English school of rock. It was a double thing not just a poke at the superstarlike people.. It was fun you know? In another interview for BBC Breakfast in October 2014, he said that he wanted to use the name Billy Idle but thought the name would be unavailable due to its similarity to the name of Monty Python star Eric Idle and chose Billy Idol insteadIn late 1976, he joined the newlyformed West London 1960s retrorock band Chelsea as a guitarist. The acts singerfrontman Gene October styled Idols image advising him to change his short sighted eyeglasses for contact lenses and dye his hair blonde with a crew cut for a retro1950s rocker look. After a few weeks performing with Chelsea Idol and Tony James the bands bass guitarist quit the act and cofounded Generation X with Idol switching from guitarist to the role of singerfrontman. Generation X was one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme Top of the Pops. Although a punk rock band they were inspired by mid1960s British pop in sharp contrast to their more militant peers with Idol stating We were saying the opposite to the Clash and the Pistols. They were singing No Elvis Beatles or the Rolling Stones but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones.\nIn 1977, Idol sang Your Generation on the TV series Marc.

He is a Member of Honour of the International Music Council.\n\nFamily\nHe is the grandson of Cuban composer Ernestina Lecuona y Casado. His greatuncle Ernesto Lecuona composed La Malague\u00f1a and his second cousin Margarita Lecuona composed Babal\u00fa which was popularized by Cuban musician and actor Desi Arnaz.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nBrouwer was born in Havana. When he was 13, he began classical guitar with the encouragement of his father who was an amateur guitarist. His teacher was Isaac Nicola who was a student of Emilio Pujol who was himself a student of Francisco T\u00e1rrega. At age 17 he performed publicly for the first time and began composingBrouwer went to the United States to study music at the Hartt College of Music of the University of Hartford and later at the Juilliard School where he studied under Vincent Persichetti and took composition classes with Stefan Wolpe.\nIn 1970 Brouwer played in the premiere of El Cimarr\u00f3n by Hans Werner Henze in Berlin. Together with Morton Feldman he was awarded a 1972 scholarship by the DAAD German Academic Exchange Service and to work as a guest composer and lecturer at the Academy of Science and Arts of Berlin. In Germany Brouwer also recorded a number of LPs for Deutsche Grammophon.\n\nComposing and performing\nIn his early compositions Brouwer remained close to the rhythms of Cuban music while later he was drawn to aleatoric music. During the 1960s and 70s he became interested in the music of modernist composers such as Luigi Nono and Iannis Xenakis using indeterminacy in works such as Sonograma I. Other works from this period include the guitar pieces Canticum 1968) La espiral eterna 1971) Par\u00e1bola 1973) and Tarantos 1974). More recently Brouwers works have leaned towards tonality and modality. The solo guitar works El Decamer\u00f3n Negro 1981) Paisaje cubano con campanas 1986) and the Sonata 1990; for Julian Bream exemplify this tendency. His playing career ended in the early 1980s due to an injury to a tendon in his right hand middle fingerBrouwer has written for guitar piano and percussion and has composed orchestral works ballet and music for over one hundred movies including the film Like Water for Chocolate. For a guitar competition in Hungary in 1979, he wrote a composition that employed 200 guitarists. He is known for a series of  studies called the Etudes Simples. Brouwer has also transcribed Beatles songs for classical guitarHe has performed and recorded works by Sylvano Bussotti Hans Werner Henze Maurice Ohana Crist\u00f3bal Halffter Leni Alexander Cornelius Cardew and Heitor VillaLobos.\n\nOther activities\nHe has been a conductor for many symphony orchestras including the BBC Concert Orchestra the Berlin Philharmonic and the Cordoba Symphony in SpainBrouwer is involved in the Concurso y Festival Internacional de Guitarra de la Habana Havana International Guitar Festival and Competition. He frequently travels to attend guitar festivals throughout the world and especially to other Latin American countriesBrouwer according to the composer himself has never been a member of the Communist Party of Cuba but has nevertheless held a number of official posts in Cuba including with the music department of the Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry.\nBrouwer is the greatuncle of Al Jourgensen of Ministry fame.

He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston but he left for Atlanta in 1997 with fellow guitarist Clay Cook with whom he formed the shortlived rock duo LoFi Masters. After their split Mayer continued to play at local clubs refining his skills and gaining a minor following. He performed at the 2000 South by Southwest festival and was subsequently signed by Aware Records an imprint of Columbia Records through which he released his debut extended play EP Inside Wants Out 1999). His first two studio albumsRoom for Squares 2001) and Heavier Things 2003)were both met with critical and commercial success the former won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for its single Your Body Is a Wonderland while the latter peaked atop the Billboard 200.\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records and further delved into the blues and rock music of which originally influenced his artistry. Forming the John Mayer Trio he released the live album Try! 2005) and his third studio album Continuum 2006). Both were met with positive critical reception while the latter received a nomination for Album of the Year and won both Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for its single Waiting on the World to Change at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. It was followed by Battle Studies 2009) which marked his return to pop.\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon for the sound of his fifth studio album Born and Raised 2012). Discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel its accompanying tour. Despite favorable reception and becoming his second release to peak atop the Billboard 200, the album was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer recovered in January 2013 and released his sixth studio album Paradise Valley 2013) in August of that year which peaked at number two on the chart and incorporated country folk and Americana influences. His seventh album The Search for Everything 2017) was a loose concept based around themes of a romantic breakup. His eighth Sob Rock 2021) was inspired by 1980s soft rock music.\nIn 2015, three former members of the Grateful Dead joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band Dead  Company.

By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.\n\nEarly life\nMayer was born on October 16, 1977, in Bridgeport Connecticut. His father Richard Mayer b. 1927) was principal at Central High School in Bridgeport and his mother Margaret n\u00e9e Hoffman b. 1947) was a middleschool English teacher. He grew up in nearby Fairfield the middle child between older halfsister Rachel older brother Carl and younger brother Ben. His father is Jewish and Mayer has said that he relates to Judaism. As an elementary school student Mayer became close friends with future tennis star James Blake and they played Nintendo together weekday afternoons after school for three years. He attended the Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk for his junior year then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad a magnet program for learning Japanese.After watching Michael J. Foxs guitar performance as Marty McFly in Back to the Future Mayer became fascinated with the instrument. When he turned 13 years old his father rented one for him. A neighbor gave Mayer a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette which cultivated Mayers love of blues music. According to Mayer his fascination with Vaughan started a genealogical hunt that led him to other blues guitarists including Buddy Guy BB. King Freddie King Albert King Otis Rush and Lightnin Hopkins. Mayer started taking lessons from a local guitar shop owner Al Ferrante and soon became consumed. His singular focus concerned his parents and they twice took him to see a psychiatrist who determined him to be healthy. Mayer says that his parents contentious marriage led him to disappear and create my own world I could believe in. After two years of practice he started playing at bars and other venues while still in high school. In addition to performing solo he was a member of a band called Villanova Junction named for a Jimi Hendrix song with Tim Procaccini Joe Beleznay and Rich WolfWhen Mayer was 17, he was stricken with cardiac dysrhythmia and was hospitalized for a weekend. Reflecting on the incident Mayer said That was the moment the songwriter in me was born and he penned his first lyrics the night he left the hospital. Shortly thereafter he began suffering from panic attacks and says he feared having to enter a mental institution. He continues to manage such episodes with antianxiety medication.\n\nCareer\nEarly career 1996\u20131999)\nMayer considered skipping college to pursue music but his parents dissuaded him. He enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in 1997 at age 19. At the urging of his college friend Clay Cook they left Berklee after two semesters and moved to Atlanta there they formed a twoman band called LoFi Masters and began performing in local coffee houses and club venues such as Eddies Attic. According to Cook they experienced musical differences due to Mayers desire to move more towards pop music. The two parted ways and Mayer embarked on a solo careerWith the help of local producer and engineer Glenn Matullo Mayer recorded the independent EP Inside Wants Out. The EP includes eight songs with Mayer on lead vocals and guitars. For the opening track Back To You a full band was enlisted including the EPs coproducer David DeLa LaBruyere on bass guitars. Cook had cowritten many of the albums songs including its first commercial single release No Such Thing however his only performance contribution was backing vocals on the song Comfortable.\n\nMajor label and commercial success 2000\u20132004)\nMayer and LaBruyere performed throughout Georgia and nearby states. Also as his career coincided with the thennascent internet music market Mayer benefited from an online following. Mayer came to the attention of Gregg Latterman at Aware Records through an acquaintance of Mayers a lawyer who sent Aware his EP. In early 2001, after including him in Aware Festival concerts and his songs on Aware compilations Aware released Mayers internetonly album Room for Squares. During this time Aware concluded a deal with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first pick in signing Aware artists. In September Columbia remixed and rereleased Room for Squares. As part of the major label debut the albums artwork was updated and the track 3x5\" was added. The rerelease included reworked studio versions of the first four songs from Inside Wants OutBy the end of 2002, Room for Squares had spawned several radio hits including No Such Thing Your Body Is a Wonderland and Why Georgia. It also received general praise critically and Mayer drew comparisons to Dave Matthews. In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for Your Body Is a Wonderland. In his acceptance speech he remarked This is very very fast and I promise to catch up. He also figuratively referred to himself as being 16, a remark that many mistook to mean that he was 16 years old at the timeIn February 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in Birmingham Alabama titled Any Given Thursday which included songs previously not recorded such as Man on the Side Somethings Missing and Covered in Rain. Commercially the album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200 chart. Its accompanying DVD release received conservativealthough consistentpraise with critics torn between his popidol image and at the time emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford of AllMusic asked Is Mayer the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughans Lenny or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays Your Body Is a Wonderland? That summer Mayer went on the road with Counting Crows in a tour that spanned 42 dates between July 7 and September 2Heavier Things Mayers second album was released in 2003 to generally favorable reviews. Rolling Stone Allmusic and Blender all gave positive although reserved feedback. The album was commercially successful and while it did not sell as well as Room for Squares it peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.

He dedicated the award to his grandmother Annie Hoffman who had died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. On February 9, 2009, Mayer told Ellen DeGeneres that he thought he should not have won the Grammy for Song of the year because he thought that Alicia Keys If I Aint Got You was the better song. Because of this he removed the top half of the Grammy and gave it to Keys and kept the bottom part for himself. At the 37th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 2006, Mayer received the Hal David Starlight AwardMayer again recorded live concerts across seven nights of his US. tour in 2004.

The album included a previously unreleased cover of Marvin Gayes song Inner City Blues Make Me Wanna Holler featuring a solo from Mayers supporting actjazz and blues turntablist DJ Logic. The album covers of the AsIs releases feature drawings of anthropomorphic bunnies.\n\nChange in musical direction 2005\u20132008)\nAs early as 2002, Chris Willman with Entertainment Weekly said that Mayer was more historically savvy and more ambitious than youd guess from the unforced earnestness of Room for Squares. However Mayer was largely associated with the Adult Contemporary and singersongwriter genres. Fame allowed him access to his early influences and he began collaborating with blues and jazz artists. He accompanied Buddy Guy in a concert at the Irving Plaza in December 2003. He toured with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock including a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. He also performed on commercial releases namely with Eric Clapton Back Home Crossroads Guitar Festival Buddy Guy Bring Em In John Scofield Thats What I Say and BB. King 80). Although Mayer maintained his reputation as a singersongwriter he gained distinction as a guitarist.\nFollowing the conclusion of his Heavier Things tour Mayer began working with artists including those from other genres of music. His voice was sampled on the song Go by rapper Common and he appeared on a hidden track called Bittersweet Poetry from the Kanye West album Graduation. The collaborations drew praise from rap heavyweights JayZ and Nelly. When asked about his presence in the hip hop community Mayer said Its not music out there right now. Thats why to me hiphop is where rock used to be.\nAround this time Mayer announced that he was closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity. In the spring of 2005, Mayer formed the John Mayer Trio with bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan both of whom he had met through studio sessions. The trio combined blues and rock music.

On November 17, 2009, Mayers fourth studio album Battle Studies debuted at number one on the US. Billboard 200 album chart. The first single Who Says was released on September 24, 2009, in advance of the album followed on October 19 by Heartbreak Warfare and Half of My Heart on June 21, 2010. The accompanying arena tour grossed US45 million. Despite the albums commercial success critics reactions were mixed. Some reviews glowed calling it his most adventurous others called the album safe and noted that Mayer the singersongwriter and Mayer the man about town sometimes seem disconnected like they dont even belong in the same body. Mayer admitted to Rolling Stone that he thought Battle Studies was not his best album.\n\nPersonal troubles and hiatus 2010\u20132013)\nFollowing two revealing and highly controversial magazine interviews in February 2010 with Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines Mayer withdrew from public life and ceased giving interviews. While still on tour for Battle Studies he began work in earnest on his fifth studio albumwhich drew on the popular music of Laurel Canyon in the early 1970s. Around this time he began to experience vocal problems and sought medical assistance. On September 16, 2011, he posted on his blog that his next record Born and Raised would be delayed due to treatment he was receiving for a granuloma discovered on his vocal cords. Mayer described the event as a temporary setback and added that the album was entirely finished except for a few vocal tracks. A month later on October 20, 2011, Mayer posted I had surgery this afternoon to remove it and am now on complete vocal rest for a month or more during which he planned to travel the country look and listen. However the surgery did not work as expected and he had to undergo another one that August. During his travels he visited and fell in love with Bozeman Montana where he bought a house and resettled in the spring of 2012With his treatments complete Mayer finished the vocals on Born and Raised and the albums first single Shadow Days was released on February 27, 2012. The following day he released the track listing for the album announcing that it would be released on May 22 of that year. He described it as his most honest album and begin booking dates at more intimate venues than for Battle Studies. He also accepted an invitation to appear at the South by Southwest festival. However the granuloma returned and on March 9, 2012, Mayer announced that he had been forced to cancel his tour and refrain from all singing indefinitely. Even so Born and Raised was released as scheduled and entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one selling 219,000 copies in its first week. It also received generally positive critical feedback Rolling Stone rated it number 17 on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 2012, and People magazine called it a shimmering album. Meanwhile Mayer brought a new focus to his guitar playing and fearing that his vocal cords had been permanently damaged tried to come to terms with a possible future as a session musician. Determined to be cured he sought help from the UCLA Voice Center. That September otolaryngologist Dr. Gerald Berke paralyzed Mayers vocal cords with a series of highdose Botox injections hoping that they would allow the granuloma to heal. Mayers vocal rest extended to several months and unable to even talk his performances were limited to accompanying other artists on guitar. He appeared in September 2012 on Saturday Night Live where he joined musical guest Frank Ocean. He played with the Rolling Stones in New Jersey in December 2012By January 2013, Mayer had recovered sufficiently enough to perform at a benefit concert in Bozeman after almost two years without singing publicly.

Mayer also recounted that in 2011 he happened upon a song by the Grateful Dead while listening to Pandora and that soon the bands music was all he would listen to. In February 2015, while guest hosting The Late Late Show Mayer invited Grateful Dead guitar player Bob Weir to join him in a studio performance. While Weir Phil Lesh Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann surviving members of the Grateful Dead were preparing for their Fare Thee Well Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead tour with Trey Anastasio Mayer began practicing the bands catalog of songs. That August Mayer Weir Kreutzmann and Hart formed the group Dead  Company along with Jeff Chimenti and Oteil Burbridge and began a fall tour in the United States.

Founding bassist Phil Lesh has notably declined to participate in the project although he has performed with Mayer on a few occasions since Dead  Company began. The role of bassist in Dead  Company has instead been played by Oteil Burbridge of the Allman Brothers Band. Jeff Chimenti who has toured with the various spinoffs of the Dead since the 1990s is the groups keyboardist. \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song Althea by chance on Pandora radio. In 2015, while the Deads Fare Thee Well shows with Trey Anastasio were also being planned Mayer performed Althea with Weir on The Late Late Show along with Truckin. Weir was impressed with Mayers take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2016:\n\nI was doing preliminary gettogethers with Trey kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. Theyre both explorers someone whos happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Treys take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\nI look forward to playing with Trey again any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with Johnboy and chase the music around get to know each other. When that dream came to me it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved musically speaking  being able to intuit the songs. We were feeling each other out on a new level several bars down the road.\nThe thought of pop singer Mayer stepping in for Jerry Garcia was met with some initial skepticism by both fans and music critics but the shows have since been well received. The band continues to tour 2022 and has considered recording a studio album consisting of songs from the Grateful Dead catalog and potentially some originals. In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone Lesh praised the bands performances and explained his decision not to take part\n\nI think theyre doing a great job. Theyre bringing the music to the people just like we always wanted to do and I commend them for it. I hope theyre having a good time. Its not something I could do myself Im done with that kind of touring.\n\nAuthor\nWith the June 2004 issue of Esquire Mayer began a column called Music Lessons with John Mayer.

Chris Richards in a review of a 2017 concert declared Mayer is an amazing guitar player albeit doing so through clenched teeth. Richards went on to say that his talent as a guitarist did not make him exempt from criticism of his pillowsoft songcraft the dull sentimentality of his lyrics or that cuckooracist interview he gave to Playboy back in 2010\". Music writer Steve Baltin commented on this dichotomy saying that Mayer is one of the sharpest and savviest musical minds you will ever encounter and added While many have found reasons to dislike Mayer since the beginning of his career he is a consummate musicians musician an artist who has been embraced by Eric Clapton Stevie Wonder and Buddy Guy among others.Mayers inclusion in the lineup of Dead  Company was criticised by Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes who had previously played several shows with The Grateful Dead.

Reflecting on that time in a May 2012 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show he said I lost my head for a little while and I did a couple of dumb interviews and it kind of woke me up..It was a violent crash into being an adult. For a couple of years it was just figuring it all out and Im glad I actually stayed out of the spotlight.\nSingersongwriter Taylor Swift performed vocals for the song Half of My Heart on Mayers November 2009 album Battle Studies. Rumors began to circulate in the media that the two were a couple an assertion that neither addressed. However Swift released a song called Dear John in 2010, which was widely believed to be about her relationship with him. In June 2012, Mayer criticized the song saying she never contacted him and that its abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go Wait till he gets a load of this! The song Paper Doll was reported to be a response. In the March 21, 2019, episode of Current Mood however Mayer said When Paper Doll came out 100% of the people believed it was about somebody..But the song was not about that person and I could never tell anybody Thats not true because then I would be breaking my rule that songwriters dont say who the songs are about or not about.\nIn March 2014, Mayer sued watch dealer Robert Maron for 656,000 when he discovered that seven of the 5 million in watches he purchased from the dealer contained counterfeit parts.

He was primarily a guitarist but he also played the mandolin fiddle banjo and ukulele and occasionally sang.\nAtkinss signature picking style was inspired by Merle Travis. Other major guitar influences were Django Reinhardt George Barnes Les Paul and later Jerry Reed. His distinctive picking style and musicianship brought him admirers inside and outside the country scene both in the United States and abroad. Atkins spent most of his career at RCA Victor and produced records for the Browns Hank Snow Porter Wagoner Norma Jean Dolly Parton Dottie West Perry Como Floyd Cramer Elvis Presley the Everly Brothers Eddy Arnold Don Gibson Jim Reeves Jerry Reed Skeeter Davis Waylon Jennings Roger Whittaker AnnMargret and many others.\nRolling Stone credited Atkins with inventing the popwise Nashville sound that rescued country music from a commercial slump and ranked him number 21 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2023, Atkins was named the 39th best guitarist of all time. Among many other honors Atkins received 14 Grammy Awards and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He also received nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. He was inducted into the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum. George Harrison was also inspired by Chet Atkins early Beatles songs such as All My Loving show the influence.\n\nBiography\nChildhood and early life\nAtkins was born on June 20, 1924, in Luttrell Tennessee near Clinch Mountain. His parents divorced when he was six years old after which he was raised by his mother. He was the youngest of three boys and a girl. He started out on the ukulele later moving on to the fiddle but he made a swap with his brother Lowell when he was nine an old pistol and some chores for a guitar. He stated in his 1974 autobiography We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression. Forced to relocate to Fortson Georgia outside of Columbus to live with his father because of a critical asthma condition Atkins was a sensitive youth who became obsessed with music. Because of his illness he was forced to sleep in a straightback chair to breathe comfortably. On those nights he played his guitar until he fell asleep holding it a habit that lasted his whole life. While living in Fortson  Atkins attended the historic Mountain Hill School. He returned in the 1990s to play a series of charity concerts to save the school from demolition.\nStories have been told about the very young Chet who when a friend or relative would come to visit and play guitar crowded the musician and put his ear so close to the instrument that it became difficult for the visitor to playAtkins became an accomplished guitarist while he was in high school. He used the restroom in the school to practice because it had good acoustics. His first guitar had a nail for a nut and was so bowed that only the first few frets could be used. He later purchased a semiacoustic electric guitar and amp but he had to travel many miles to find an electrical outlet since his home didnt have electricityLater in life he lightheartedly gave himself along with John Knowles Tommy Emmanuel Steve Wariner and Jerry Reed the honorary degree CGP Certified Guitar Player.\nIn 2011, his daughter Merle Atkins Russell bestowed the CGP degree on his longtime sideman Paul Yandell.  She then declared no more CGPs would be allowed by the Atkins estateHis halfbrother Jim was a successful guitarist who worked with the Les Paul Trio in New YorkAtkins did not have a strong style of his own until 1939 when while still living in Georgia he heard Merle Travis picking over WLW radio. This early influence dramatically shaped his unique playing style. Whereas Travis used his index finger on his right hand for the melody and his thumb for the bass notes Atkins expanded his righthand style to include picking with his first three fingers with the thumb on bass.  He also listened closely to the singlestring playing of George Barnes and Les Paul.\nChet Atkins was an amateur radio general class licensee. Formerly using the call sign WA4CZD he obtained the vanity call sign W4CGP in 1998 to include the CGP designation which supposedly stood for Certified Guitar Picker. He was a member of the American Radio Relay League.\n\nEarly musical career\nAfter dropping out of high school in 1942, Atkins landed a job at WNOX AM now WNML radio in Knoxville where he played fiddle and guitar with the singer Bill Carlisle and the comic Archie Campbell and became a member of the stations Dixieland Swingsters a small swing instrumental combo. After three years he moved to WLWAM in Cincinnati Ohio where Merle Travis had formerly worked.\nAfter six months he moved to Raleigh and worked with Johnnie and Jack before heading for Richmond Virginia where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman. Atkinss shy personality worked against him as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly country. He was fired often but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing abilityAtkins and Jethro Burns of Homer and Jethro married twin sisters Leona and Lois Johnson who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived her husband by eight years dying in 2009 at the age of 85Travelling to Chicago Atkins auditioned for Red Foley who was leaving his star position on WLSAMs National Barn Dance to join the Grand Ole Opry. Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foleys band. He also recorded a single for Nashvillebased Bullet Records that year. That single Guitar Blues was fairly progressive including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan and produced by Owen Bradley. He had a solo spot on the Opry but when that was cut Atkins moved on to KWTO in Springfield Missouri. Despite the support of executive Si Siman however he soon was fired for not sounding country enough.\n\nSigning with RCA Victor\nWhile working with a Western band in Denver Colorado Atkins came to the attention of RCA Victor. Siman had been encouraging Steve Sholes to sign Atkins as his style with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist was suddenly in vogue. Sholes AR director of country music at RCA tracked Atkins down in Denver.\nHe made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOXs new Saturday night radio show The Tennessee Barn Dance and the popular Midday Merry Go Round.\nIn 1949, he left WNOX to join June Carter with Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters on KWTO. This incarnation of the Carter Family featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June Helen and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to Nashville in the mid1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on WSMAM and the Opry. Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950sWhile he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New Yorkbased producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkinss first hit single was Mr. Sandman followed by Silver Bell which he recorded as a duet with Hank Snow. His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABCTVs The Eddy Arnold Show in the summer of 1956 and on Country Music Jubilee in 1957 and 1958 by then renamed Jubilee USA.\n\nIn addition to recording Atkins was a design consultant for Gretsch which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955 to 1980. He became manager of RCA Victors Nashville studios eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary RCA Studio B the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the nowfamous Music Row. Also later on Chet and Owen Bradley would become instrumental in the creation of studio Bs adjacent building RCA Studio A as well.\n\nPerformer and producer\nWhen Sholes took over pop production in 1957\u2014a result of his success with Elvis Presleyhe put Atkins in charge of RCA Victors Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular Atkins took his cue from Owen Bradley and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar from many recordings though not all as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans many of whom disliked the twang elements of country. This became known as the Nashville Sound which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country and their jobs viable.\nAtkins used the Jordanaires and a rhythm section on hits such as Jim Reevess Four Walls and Hell Have to Go and Don Gibsons Oh Lonesome Me and Blue Blue Day. The oncerare phenomenon of having a country hit cross over to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the drivers seat guiding an artists choice of material and the musical background. Other Nashville producers quickly copied this successful formula which resulted in certain country hits crossing over to find success in the pop field.\nAtkins made his own records which usually visited pop standards and jazz in a sophisticated home studio often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home refining the tracks until the results satisfied him. Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period he became known internationally as Mister Guitar inspiring an album Mister Guitar engineered by both Bob Ferris and Bill Porter Ferriss replacement.\n\nAt the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at what was at the time RCA Victors only Nashville studio in the space that would become known as Studio B after the opening of a second studio in 1960. At the time RCAs sole Nashville studio had no letter designation Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studios German effects device an EMT plate reverb. With his golden ear Porter found the studios acoustics to be problematic and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling then selected positions for microphones based on resonant room modes. The sound of the recordings improved significantly and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more dynamic. In later years when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound Atkins told him it was Porter. Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recordingif someone was out of tune he would not single that person out by name. Instead he would say something like we got a little tuning problem ... Everybody check and see whats going on. If that did not work Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late1964, Atkins said the sound was never the same never as great.Atkinss trademark Atkins style of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger which was exactly how Travis played and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingersand that was the style he pioneered and mastered.\nHe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians and they were asked to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting but a live recording of the group After the Riot at Newport was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the White House for every US. president from John F. Kennedy through to George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the Million Dollar Band during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song Yankee Doodle Dixie in which he played Yankee Doodle and Dixie simultaneously on the same guitar.\nBefore his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCAs country division. In 1987, he told NineOOne Network magazine that he was ashamed of his promotion I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know too that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president. He had brought Waylon Jennings Willie Nelson Connie Smith Bobby Bare Dolly Parton Jerry Reed and John Hartford to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others. He took a considerable risk during the mid1960s when the civil rights movement sparked violence throughout the South by signing country musics first AfricanAmerican singer Charley Pride who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.\nAtkinss biggest hit single came in 1965, with Yakety Axe an adaptation of Yakety Sax by his friend the saxophonist Boots Randolph. He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers such as Bob Ferguson and Felton Jarvis to lessen his workload.\n\nLater career\nIn the 1970s Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records but could still turn out hits such as Perry Comos 1973 pop hit And I Love You So. He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of colon cancer however led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA Records to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love the guitar often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro his brotherinlaw after Homer died in 1971. Atkins would turn over his administrative duties to Jerry Bradley son of Owen in 1973 at RCA.\nAtkins did little production work at RCA after stepping down and in fact had hired producers at the label in the 1960s among them Bob Ferguson and Felton Jarvis. As a recording artist Atkins grew disillusioned with RCA in the late 1970s. He felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. He had also produced late 60s jazz recordings by Canadian guitarist Lenny Breau a friend and protege. His mid1970s collaborations with one of his influences Les Paul Chester  Lester and Guitar Monsters had already reflected that interest Chester  Lester was one of the bestselling recordings of Atkinss career. At the same time he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch no longer familyowned was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with Gibson. In 1982, Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA Records and signed with rival Columbia Records. He produced his first album for Columbia in 1983Atkins had always been an ardent lover of jazz and throughout his career he was often criticized by pure country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being referred to as a country guitarist insisting that he was a guitarist period. Although he played by ear and was a masterful improviser he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When Roger C. Field a friend suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer he did so with Suzy BoggussAtkins returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with Mark Knopfler and Jerry Reed. Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend Tommy Emmanuel. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the twentieth century he named Django Reinhardt to the first position and also placed himself on the listIn later years he returned to radio appearing on Garrison Keillors Prairie Home Companion program on American Public Media radio even picking up a fiddle from time to time and performing songs such as Bob Willss Corrina Corrina and Willie Nelsons Seven Spanish Angels with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the Bridges Auditorium on the campus of Pomona College.\n\nDeath and legacy\nAtkins received numerous awards including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Billboard magazine awarded him its Century Award its highest honor for distinguished creative achievement in December 1997Atkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist James P. Johnsons Johnson Rag all the way to the rock stylings of Eric Johnson an invited guest on Atkinss recording sessions who when Atkins attempted to copy his influential rocker Cliffs of Dover led to Atkinss creation of a unique arrangement of Londonderry Air Danny Boy.\nThe classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were for many American artists working in the field today the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded smooth jazz guitar still played on American airwaves today.\nAtkins continued performing in the 1990s but his health declined after he was diagnosed again with colon cancer in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville Tennessee at the age of 77. His memorial service was held at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.

Armstrong stated in an interview with Spin about the inspiration behind the Green Day song Armitage Shanks in 1995: It was right before Dookie came out and I was really at odds with myself. I was like Man do I really want to do this? A lot of time I was thinking about suicide how its so easy to kill yourself but its so hard to stay alive. I was in a breakup with my thengirlfriend a total raving punk rocker who didnt approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldnt live in a world with McDonalds and such. It was fucking me up pretty bad.

Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon 1973) Wish You Were Here 1975) Animals 1977) The Wall 1979) and The Final Cut 1983). By the early 1980s they had become one of the highestselling and most acclaimed acts in music history by 2012, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide including 75 million in the United States. Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmours leadership and released three more studio albums.\nGilmour has produced a variety of artists such as the Dream Academy and has released four solo studio albums David Gilmour 1978) About Face 1984) On an Island 2006) and Rattle That Lock 2015). He is also credited for bringing the singersongwriter Kate Bush to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2003, Gilmour was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE. He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked him number 28 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was also voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock listeners in 2009Gilmour has taken part in projects related to issues including animal rights environmentalism homelessness poverty and human rights. He has married twice and is the father of eight children.\n\nEarly life and education\nDavid Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge England. His father Douglas Gilmour was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge and his mother Sylvia n\u00e9e Wilson trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC. At the time of Gilmours birth they lived in Trumpington Cambridgeshire. In 1956, after several relocations they moved to nearby Grantchester MeadowsGilmours parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music and in 1954 he bought his first single Bill Haleys Rock Around the Clock. His enthusiasm was stirred the following year by Elvis Presleys Heartbreak Hotel and later Bye Bye Love by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour but never gave it back. Soon afterward Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger. At age 11, Gilmour began attending Perse School on Hills Road Cambridge which he did not enjoy. There he met the future Pink Floyd members Syd Barrett and Roger Waters who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys also situated on Hills RoadIn 1962, Gilmour began studying ALevel modern languages at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology. Despite not finishing the course he eventually learned to speak fluent French. Barrett was also a student at the college and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour. In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild. The band recorded a onesided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio in Denmark Street west London but only 50 copies of each were madeIn 1965, Gilmour hitchhiked to SaintTropez France. Barrett and friends also drove there and met up with Gilmour. In France they were arrested for busking. He and Barrett later went to Paris where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre. During this time Gilmour worked in various places most notably as the driver and assistant for the fashion designer Ossie ClarkGilmour travelled to France in mid1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers then Bullitt but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits club owners were reluctant to pay them and soon after their arrival in Paris thieves stole their equipment. In France Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September starring Brigitte Bardot. When Bullitt returned to England later that year they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing.\n\nCareer\nPink Floyd\nIn 1967, Pink Floyd composed of Gilmours Cambridge schoolmates Barrett and Waters with Nick Mason and Richard Wright released their debut studio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. That May Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay he watched Pink Floyd record See Emily Play and was shocked to find that Barrett who was beginning to suffer mental health problems did not seem to recognise himIn December 1967, after Gilmour had returned to England Mason invited him to join Pink Floyd to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. One of the bands business partners Peter Jenner said the plan was to have Gilmour cover for Barretts eccentricities. By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult and he agreed to leave the band. Mason said later After Syd Dave was the difference between light and dark. He was absolutely into form and shape and he introduced that into the wilder numbers wed created. We became far less difficult to enjoy I think. In 1970, Gilmour attended the Isle of Wight Festival and assisted in the live mix of Jimi Hendrixs performanceIn the 1970s Gilmour received a copy of a demo tape by the teenage songwriter Kate Bush from Ricky Hopper a mutual friend of both families. Impressed Gilmour paid for Bush then 16, to record three professional demo tracks to present to record labels. The tape was produced by Gilmours friend Andrew Powell who went on to produce Bushs first two studio albums and the sound engineer Geoff Emerick. Gilmour arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape and he signed her. Gilmour is credited as the executive producer on two tracks on Bushs debut studio album The Kick Inside 1978) including her second single The Man with the Child in His Eyes. He performed backing vocals on Pull Out the Pin on her fourth studio album The Dreaming 1982) and played guitar on Love and Anger and Rockets Tail on her sixth The Sensual World 1989). In 1975, Gilmour played on Roy Harpers album HQ 1975).\n\nFirst solo works\nBy the late 1970s Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo studio album David Gilmour which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album but too late to be used was incorporated into a song by Waters which became Comfortably Numb on the Pink Floyd album The Wall 1979).Wright was fired during the Wall sessions the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the Wall film and the album The Final Cut 1983). The negative atmosphere led Gilmour to produce his second solo studio album About Face in 1984. He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics from his relationship with Waters to the murder of John Lennon. Gilmour toured Europe and the US supported by the Television Personalities who were dropped after the singer Dan Treacy revealed Barretts address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists and produced the Dream Academy including their US topten hit Life in a Northern Town 1986).Gilmour cowrote five songs on Roy Harpers album The Unknown Soldier 1980) including Short and Sweet which was first recorded for Gilmours first solo album. In April 1984, Harper made a surprise guest appearance at Gilmours Hammersmith Odeon gig to sing Short and Sweet. This was included in Gilmours Live 1984 concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmours second solo studio album About Face 1984).In 1985, Gilmour played on Bryan Ferrys sixth solo studio album Boys and Girls as well as the song Is Your Love Strong Enough for the US release of the Ridley ScottTom Cruise film Legend 1985). The music video for Is Your Love Strong Enough incorporated Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film. In July that year Gilmour played with Ferry at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London. He contributed to Pete Townshends White City A Novel notably the single Give Blood.\n\nLeading Pink Floyd\nIn 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were a spent force creatively and attempted to dissolve the band. Gilmour and Mason announced that they intended to continue without him. Waters resigned in 1987, leaving Gilmour as the band leader. In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio. He produced the Pink Floyd studio album A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with contributions from Mason and Wright. He believed Pink Floyd had become too driven by lyrics under Waters leadership and attempted to restore the balance of music and lyrics.\nIn March 1987, Gilmour played guitar for Kate Bushs performance of Running Up That Hill at the Secret Policemans Third BallPink Floyd released their second album under Gilmours leadership The Division Bell in 1994. In December 1999, Gilmour played guitar alongside Mick Green Ian Paice Pete Wingfield and Chris Hall for Paul McCartney at a concert at the Cavern Club in Liverpool England.

The performance caused a sales increase of Pink Floyds compilation album Echoes The Best of Pink Floyd 2001). Gilmour donated his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives. He called upon all Live 8 artists to donate their extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for 150 million. In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would likely never tour or write material again. He said I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I dont have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life I have had a wonderful time but its over. For me its much less complicated to work alone.On 6 March 2006, Gilmours 60th birthday he released his third solo album On an Island. It featured guest musicians including Wright and lyrics by Gilmours wife Polly Samson. It debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and became Gilmours first solo album to enter the top ten in the US reaching number six on the Billboard 200.

Gilmour said he had several songs which are almost complete which did not make it onto Rattle That LockWaters and Gilmour have continued to quarrel arguing over subjects including album reissues and the use of the Pink Floyd website and social media channels. Mason said in 2018 that Waters did not respect Gilmour as that Waters feels that writing is everything and that guitar playing and the singing are something that I wont say anyone can do but that everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing.\n\n2020s Hey Hey Rise Up! and fifth solo album\nFrom April 2020, Gilmour appeared in a series of livestreams with his family performing songs by Barrett and Leonard Cohen. In July 2020, he released Yes I Have Ghosts his first single since 2015. Its lyrics were written by Samson and features his daughter Romany making her recording debut on backing vocals and harpIn 2021, Rolling Stone noted that Gilmour and Waters had hit yet another low point in their relationship.

Gilmour said I copied  dont be afraid to copy  and eventually something that I suppose that I would call my own appeared.\nWriting for the magazine Far Out in 2022, Jordan Potter described Gilmour as having a unique and constantly developing guitar style in Pink Floyd adding that drawing from a healthy pool of influence he could devise his own characteristic style recognised for its sonorous gravity and pitchperfect lead excursions which valued precision over speed. Gilmours lead guitar style is characterised by bluesinfluenced phrasing expressive note bends and sustain. In a 1985 interview he said I cant play like Eddie Van Halen I wish I could ... Sometimes I think I should work at the guitar more. I play every day but I dont consciously practice scales or anything in particular. In 2006, Gilmour said My fingers make a distinctive sound.. they arent very fast but I think I am instantly recognisable. Pink Floyd technician Phil Taylor said It really is just his fingers his vibrato his choice of notes and how he sets his effects ... In reality no matter how well you duplicate the equipment you will never be able to duplicate the personality.Gilmour also plays bass keyboards banjo lap steel mandolin harmonica drums and saxophone. Gilmour said he played bass on some Pink Floyd tracks such as the fretless bass on Hey You as he could do it more quickly than Waters he said that Waters would thank him for winning him bassplaying polls.\n\nInfluence\nAccording to MusicRadar Gilmour is a household name among the classic rock crowd and for a lot of younger guitar fans hes the only 1970s guitarist that matters. For many hes the missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen. The MusicRader writer Billy Saefong wrote that Gilmour isnt as flashy as Jimi Hendrix or Jimmy Page on the stage but his guitar work outshines most for emotion.In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He has been ranked one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including Rolling Stone and The Daily Telegraph. In January 2007, Guitar World readers voted Gilmours solos for Comfortably Numb Time and Money among the top 100 greatest guitar solos. In 2011, Rolling Stone named Gilmour the 14thgreatest guitarist of all timeGilmour was cited by the Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery as one of his three main influences. John Mitchell the guitarist of bands including It Bites and Arena also cites Gilmour as an influence. In 2013, Gary Kemp the guitarist and songwriter of Spandau Ballet and a member of Nick Masons Saucerful of Secrets argued that Gilmours work on The Dark Side of the Moon must make him the best guitar player in recent history.\n\nGuitars\nFor Gilmours 21st birthday in March 1967, his parents gave him his first Fender guitar a white Telecaster with a white pickguard and a rosewood fretboard. He used this guitar when he joined Pink Floyd in 1968, with one of Barretts Telecasters as a spare.\n\nThe Black Strat\nGilmour used the Black Strat a Fender Stratocaster in most Pink Floyd concerts and for every Pink Floyd studio album recorded between 1970 and 1983. Gilmour bought it at Mannys Music in New York City in 1970, after the bands US tour was cancelled due to the theft of their equipment in New Orleans. The guitar which originally had a rosewood fretboard and a white pickguard underwent a number of modifications settling on a black pickguard and maple neck.

Both guitars are based on extensive measurements of the original instrument each featuring varying degrees of wear. The most expensive is the David Gilmour Relic Stratocaster which features the closest copy of wear on the original guitar. A pristine copy of the guitar is also made the David Gilmour NOS Stratocaster.\n\nThe 0001 Strat\nThe 0001 Strat is a Fender Stratocaster with a white body maple neck threeway pick up selector and a gold anodized pickguard and goldplated hardware. Gilmour bought it from guitar technician Phil Taylor who had purchased it from Seymour W. Duncan. Duncan states it is a partscaster as he assembled it from two different guitars. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 Strat Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Stratocasters famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987 to 2004). It has the serial number 0001; however prototypes had been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown and it is unknown whether it is the real 0001 Strat because the neck which has the 0001 serial number on it could have been taken off the original. The model was used as a spare and for slide guitar in subsequent years. In 2019, the 0001 Strat was sold at auction for 1,815,000, setting a new world auction record for a Stratocaster.

Martin models used include a D35, purchased in New York in 1971, and a D12-28 12-string.\n\nSteel guitar\nGilmour used a pair of Jedson steel guitars and a Fender 1000 pedal steel frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in Seattle in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of One of These Days from Meddle and Breathe and The Great Gig in the Sky from Dark Side of the Moon. Gilmour also owns a Fender Deluxe lap steel which he used during The Division Bell tour in 1994. Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model.

He was ranked 7th by MTV in the 22 Greatest Voices in Music and was placed 20th by Hit Parader on their 2006 list of the 100 Greatest Metal Singers of All Time.\n\nEarly life\nKurt Donald Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen Washington on February 20, 1967, the son of waitress Wendy Elizabeth n\u00e9e Fradenburg born 1948) and car mechanic Donald Leland Cobain born 1946). His parents married in Coeur dAlene Idaho on July 31, 1965. Cobain had Dutch English French German Irish and Scottish ancestry\u200a13\u200a\u200a7\u200a The Cobain surname comes from his Irish ancestors who emigrated from the Northern Irish town of Carrickmore in 1875\u200a7\u200a Researchers found that they were shoemakers originally surnamed Cobane and came from the Inishatieve area of Carrickmore. They first settled in Canada where they lived in Cornwall Ontario before moving to Washington. Cobain mistakenly believed that his Irish ancestors came from County Cork. His younger sister Kimberly was born on April 24, 1970Cobains family had a musical background. His maternal uncle Chuck Fradenburg played in a band called the Beachcombers his aunt Mari Earle played guitar and performed in bands throughout Grays Harbor County and his greatuncle Delbert had a career as an Irish tenor making an appearance in the 1930 film King of Jazz. Kurt was described as a happy and excitable child who also exhibited sensitivity and care. His talent as an artist was evident from an early age as he would draw his favorite characters from films and cartoons such as the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Donald Duck in his bedroom\u200a11\u200a He was encouraged by his grandmother Iris Cobain a professional artist. Cobain developed an interest in music at a young age. According to his aunt Mari he began singing at the age of two. At age four he started playing the piano and singing writing a song about a trip to a park. He listened to artists including Electric Light Orchestra ELO and from a young age would sing songs including Arlo Guthries Motorcycle Song the Beatles Hey Jude Terry Jacks Seasons in the Sun and the theme song to the Monkees television show\u200a9\u200aWhen Cobain was nine years old his parents divorced\u200a20\u200a He later said the divorce had a profound effect on his life and his mother noted that his personality changed dramatically Cobain became defiant and withdrawn\u200a17\u200a In a 1993 interview he said he felt ashamed of his parents as a child and had desperately wanted to have a typical family ... I wanted that security so I resented my parents for quite a few years because of that. His parents found new partners after the divorce. Although his father had promised not to remarry he married Jenny Westeby to Kurts dismay\u200a24\u200a Cobain his father Westeby and her two children Mindy and James moved into a new household. Cobain liked Westeby at first as she gave him the maternal attention he desired\u200a25\u200a In January 1979, Westeby gave birth to a boy Chad Cobain\u200a24\u200a This new family which Cobain insisted was not his real one was in stark contrast to the attention Cobain was used to receiving as an only boy and he became resentful of his stepmother\u200a24,\u200a25\u200a Cobains mother dated a man who was abusive Cobain witnessed the domestic violence inflicted upon her with one incident resulting in her being hospitalized with a broken arm\u200a25,\u200a26\u200a Wendy refused to press charges remaining committed to the relationship\u200a26\u200aCobain behaved insolently toward adults during this period and began bullying another boy at school. His father and Westeby took him to a therapist who concluded that he would benefit from a singlefamily environment\u200a26\u200a Both sides of the family unsuccessfully attempted to reunite his parents. On June 28, 1979, Cobains mother granted full custody to his father\u200a27\u200a Cobains teenage rebellion quickly became overwhelming for his father who placed him in the care of family and friends. While living with the bornagain Christian family of his friend Jesse Reed Cobain became a devout Christian and attended church services regularly. He later renounced Christianity engaging in what was described as antiGod rants. The song Lithium is about his experience while living with the Reed family. Religion remained an important part of his personal life and beliefs\u200a22\u200a\u200a196\u200a\u200a69\u200aAlthough uninterested in sports Cobain was enrolled in a junior high school wrestling team at the insistence of his father. He was a skilled wrestler but despised the experience. Because of the ridicule he endured from his teammates and coach he allowed himself to be pinned in an attempt to sadden his father. Later his father enlisted him in a Little League Baseball team where Cobain would intentionally strike out to avoid playing\u200a20\u201325\u200a Cobain befriended a gay student at school and was bullied by peers who concluded that he was gay. In an interview he said that he liked being associated with a gay identity because he did not like people and when they thought he was gay they left him alone. He said I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasnt. His friend tried to kiss him and Cobain backed away explaining to his friend that he was not gay but remained friends with him. According to Cobain he used to spray paint God Is Gay on pickup trucks in the Aberdeen area. Police records show that Cobain was arrested for spray painting the phrase aint got no how watchamacallit on vehicles\u200a68\u200a\nCobain often drew during classes. When given a caricature assignment for an art course Cobain drew Michael Jackson but was told by the teacher that the image was inappropriate for a school hallway. He then drew an image of thenPresident Ronald Reagan that was seen as unflattering.\u200a41\u200a Through art and electronics classes Cobain met Roger Buzz Osborne singer and guitarist of the Melvins who became his friend and introduced him to punk rock and hardcore music\u200a35,\u200a36\u200a As attested to by several of Cobains classmates and family members the first concert he attended was Sammy Hagar and Quarterflash held at the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1983\u200a44\u200a Cobain however claimed that the first live show he attended was the Melvins when they played a free concert outside the Thriftway supermarket where Osborne worked. Cobain wrote in his journals of this experience as well as in interviews singling out the impact it had on him\u200a45\u200a As a teenager living in Montesano Washington Cobain eventually found escape through the thriving Pacific Northwest punk scene going to punk rock shows in SeattleDuring his second year in high school Cobain began living with his mother in Aberdeen. Two weeks prior to graduation he dropped out of Aberdeen High School upon realizing that he did not have enough credits to graduate. His mother gave him an ultimatum find employment or leave. After one week Cobain found his clothes and other belongings packed away in boxes\u200a35\u200a Feeling banished Cobain stayed with friends occasionally sneaking back into his mothers basement\u200a37\u200a Cobain also claimed that during periods of homelessness he lived under a bridge over the Wishkah River\u200a37\u200a an experience that inspired the song Something in the Way. His future bandmate Krist Novoselic later said He hung out there but you couldnt live on those muddy banks with the tides coming up and down. That was his own revisionism. In late 1986, Cobain moved into an apartment paying his rent by working at the Polynesian Resort a themed resort on the Pacific coast at Ocean Shores Washington approximately 20 miles 32 km west of Aberdeen\u200a43\u200a During this period he traveled frequently to Olympia Washington to go to rock concerts\u200a46\u200a During his visits to Olympia Cobain formed a relationship with Tracy Marander. Their relationship was close but strained by financial problems and Cobains absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the Boeing plant in Auburn Washington often stealing food. Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening watching television and concentrating on art projects.\nMaranders insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write the song About a Girl which appeared on the Nirvana album Bleach. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album as well as the front and back cover photos of their Blew single. She did not become aware that Cobain wrote About a Girl about her until years after his death\u200a88\u201393\u200a\u200a116\u2013117\u200a\u200a122\u200a\u200a134\u2013136\u200a\u200a143\u200a\u200a153\u200a Soon after his separation from Marander Cobain began dating Tobi Vail an influential punk zinester of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill who embraced the DIY ethos. After meeting Vail Cobain vomited overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric love you so much it makes me sick in the song Aneurysm.\u200a152\u200a While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart his relationship with her waned he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship which Vail regarded as sexist within a countercultural punk rock community. Vails lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as fashion accessories.\u200a153\u200a Cobain wrote many of his songs about Vail.\n\nCareer\nEarly musical projects\nOn his 14th birthday February 20, 1981, Cobains uncle offered him the choice of either a bike or a used guitar Kurt chose the guitar. Soon he was trying to play Led Zeppelins song Stairway to Heaven. He also learned how to play Louie Louie Queens Another One Bites the Dust and the Cars My Best Friends Girl before he began working on his own songs. Cobain played lefthanded despite being forced to write righthanded\u200a22\u200aIn early 1985, Cobain formed Fecal Matter after he had dropped out of Aberdeen High School. One of several joke bands that arose from the circle of friends associated with the Melvins it initially featured Cobain singing and playing guitar Melvins drummer Dale Crover playing bass and Greg Hokanson playing drums. They spent several months rehearsing original material and covers including songs by the Ramones Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nNirvana\nDuring high school Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins practice space he met Krist Novoselic a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselics mother owned a hair salon and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Fecal Matter. After months of asking Novoselic agreed to join Cobain forming the beginnings of Nirvana\u200a45\u200a Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time as he often used Christian imagery in his work and developed an interest in Jainism and Buddhist philosophy.\n\nCobain became disenchanted after early touring because of the bands inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty in supporting themselves financially. During their first few years playing together Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a succession of drummers. Eventually the band settled on Chad Channing with whom Nirvana recorded the album Bleach released on Sub Pop Records in 1989. Cobain however became dissatisfied with Channings style and subsequently fired him. He and Novoselic eventually hired Dave Grohl to replace Channing. Grohl helped the band record their 1991 majorlabel debut Nevermind. With Neverminds lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream popularizing a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Since their debut Nirvana has sold over 28 million albums in the United States alone and over 75 million worldwide. The success of Nevermind provided numerous Seattle bands such as Alice in Chains Pearl Jam and Soundgarden access to wider audiences. As a result alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the US. during the first half of the 1990s. Nirvana was considered the flagship band of Generation X and Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generations spokesman. He resented this characterization since he believed his artistic message had been misinterpreted by the public.\nCobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana with his underground roots and vision. He also felt persecuted by the media comparing himself to Frances Farmer whom he named a song after. He began to harbor resentment against people who claimed to be fans of the band yet refused to acknowledge or misinterpreted the bands social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism racism sexual assault and homophobia he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a gay rights benefit concert that was held to oppose Oregons 1992 Ballot Measure 9, which would have directed Oregon schools to teach that homosexuality was abnormal wrong unnatural and perverse. Cobain was a vocal supporter of the prochoice movement and Nirvana was involved in L7's Rock for Choice campaign. He received death threats from a small number of antiabortion activists for participating in the prochoice campaign with one activist threatening to shoot Cobain as soon as he stepped on a stage\u200a253\n\nOther collaborations\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American alternative rock band Screaming Trees formed a side project known as the Jury. The band featured Cobain on vocals and guitar Mark Lanegan on vocals Krist Novoselic on bass and Mark Pickerel on drums. Over two days of recording sessions on August 20 and 28, 1989, the band recorded four songs also performed by Lead Belly Where Did You Sleep Last Night? an instrumental version of Grey Goose Aint It a Shame and They Hung Him on a Cross the latter of which featured Cobain performing solo. Cobain was inspired to record the songs after receiving a copy of Lead Bellys Last Sessions from friend Slim Moon after hearing it he felt a connection to Leadbellys almost physical expressions of longing and desire.In 1990, Cobain and his girlfriend Tobi Vail of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub is Real in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a fourtrack tape machine that belonged to Vails father. In Everett Trues 2009 book Nirvana The Biography Vail is quoted as saying that Cobain would play the songs he was writing I would play the songs I was writing and wed record them on my dads fourtrack. Sometimes Id sing on the songs he was writing and play drums on them ... He was really into the fact that I was creative and into music. I dont think hed ever played music with a girl before. He was superinspiring and fun to play with. The musician Slim Moon described their sound as like the minimal quiet pop songs that Olympia is known for. Both of them sang it was really good.In 1992, Cobain contacted William S. Burroughs about a possible collaboration. Burroughs responded by sending him a recording of The Junkys Christmas which he recorded in his studio in Lawrence Kansas. Two months later at a studio in Seattle Cobain added guitar backing based on Silent Night and To Anacreon in Heaven. The two would meet shortly later in Lawrence Kansas and produce The Priest They Called Him a spoken word version of The Junkys Christmas.\n\nMusical influences\nThe Beatles were an early and lasting influence on Cobain his aunt Mari remembers him singing Hey Jude at the age of two\u200a9\u200a My aunts would give me Beatles records Cobain told Jon Savage in 1993, so for the most part I listened to the Beatles as a child and if I was lucky Id be able to buy a single. Cobain expressed a particular fondness for John Lennon whom he called his idol in his posthumously released journals and he said that he wrote the song About a Girl from Nirvanas 1989 debut album Bleach after spending three hours listening to Meet the Beatles.\u200a121\u200aCobain was also a fan of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands including Led Zeppelin ACDC Black Sabbath Aerosmith Queen and Kiss. Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands including Led Zeppelins Heartbreaker Moby Dick and Immigrant Song Black Sabbaths Hand of Doom and Kiss Do You Love Me? and wrote the Incesticide song Aero Zeppelin as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band Cobain stated I used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van. Wed be stuck with a dead battery because Id listened to Queen too much.He was introduced to punk rock and hardcore music by his Aberdeen classmate Buzz Osborne lead singer and guitarist of the Melvins who taught Cobain about punk by loaning him records and old copies of the Detroitbased magazine Creem. Punk rock proved to be a profound influence on a teenaged Cobains attitude and artistic style. His first punk rock album was Sandinista! by The Clash\u200a169\u200a but he became a bigger fan of fellow 1970s British punk band the Sex Pistols describing them as one million times more important than the Clash in his journals. He quickly discovered contemporary American hardcore bands like Black Flag Bad Brains Millions of Dead Cops and Flipper. The Melvins themselves were a major early musical influence on Cobain his admiration for them led him to drive their van on tour and help them to carry their equipment\u200a42\u200a\u200a153\u200a He and Novoselic watched hundreds of Melvins rehearsals and learned almost everything from them as stated by Cobain. The Melvins heavy grungey sound was mimicked by Nirvana on many songs from Bleach in an early interview given by Nirvana Cobain stated that their biggest fear was to be perceived as a Melvins ripoff.\u200a153\u200a After their commercial success the members of Nirvana would constantly talk about the Melvins importance to them in the pressCobain was an admirer of Jimi Hendrix and said in reference to the growing media attention on the Seattle scene at the time I mean we had Jimi Hendrix. Heck. What more do we want?. In a 1993 interview Cobain called Hendrix a great musician and a great composer and noted that I have great respect for him.Cobain was also a fan of protopunk acts like the Stooges whose 1973 album Raw Power he listed as his favorite of all time in his journals and The Velvet Underground whose 1968 song Here She Comes Now the band covered both live and in the studioThe 1980s American alternative rock band Pixies were instrumental in helping an adult Cobain develop his own songwriting style. In a 1992 interview with Melody Maker Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album Surfer Rosa convinced him to abandon his more Black Flaginfluenced songwriting in favor of the Iggy PopAerosmithtype songwriting that appeared on Nevermind. In a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone he said that Smells Like Teen Spirit was his attempt at trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that bandor at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.Cobains appreciation of early alternative rock bands also extended to Sonic Youth and REM both of which the members of Nirvana befriended and looked up to for advice. It was under recommendation from Sonic Youths Kim Gordon that Nirvana signed to DGC in 1990,\u200a162\u200a and both bands did a twoweek tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke. In 1993, Cobain said of REM If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what theyve written.. I dont know how that band does what they do. God theyre the greatest. Theyve dealt with their success like saints and they keep delivering great music.After attaining mainstream success Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known indie bands covering songs by The Vaselines Meat Puppets Wipers and Fang onstage andor in the studio wearing Daniel Johnston Tshirts during photo shoots having the K Records logo tattooed on his forearm and enlisting bands like Butthole Surfers Shonen Knife Chokebore and Half Japanese along for the In Utero tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him exGerms guitarist Pat Smear joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvanas 1993 MTV Unplugged appearance to perform three songs from their second album Meat Puppets IINirvanas Unplugged set includes renditions of The Man Who Sold the World by David Bowie and the American folk song Where Did You Sleep Last Night as adapted by Lead Belly. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author William S. Burroughs saying I remember Burroughs saying in an interview These new rocknroll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul like Leadbelly. Id never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music. I absolutely love it more than any rocknroll I ever heard. The album MTV Unplugged in New York was released posthumously in 1994. It has drawn comparisons to REM.s 1992 release Automatic for the People. In 1993, Cobain had predicted that the next Nirvana album would be pretty ethereal acoustic like REM.s last album.Yeah he talked a lot about what direction he was heading in Cobains friend REM.s lead singer Michael Stipe told Newsweek in 1994. I mean I know what the next Nirvana recording was going to sound like. It was going to be very quiet and acoustic with lots of stringed instruments. It was going to be an amazing fucking record and Im a little bit angry at him for killing himself. He and I were going to record a trial run of the album a demo tape. It was all set up. He had a plane ticket. He had a car picking him up. And at the last minute he called and said I cant come. Stipe was chosen as the godfather of Cobains and Courtney Loves daughter Frances Bean Cobain.\n\nArtistry\nAccording to Grohl Cobain believed that music comes first and lyrics second he focused primarily on the melodies. He complained when fans and rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics writing Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a secondrate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics when 90 percent of the time theyve transcribed them incorrectly?\u200a182\u200a Though Cobain insisted on the subjectivity and unimportance of his lyrics he labored and procrastinated in writing them often changing the content and order of lyrics during performances\u200a177\u200a Cobain would describe his own lyrics as a big pile of contradictions. Theyre split down the middle between very sincere opinions that I have and sarcastic opinions and feelings that I have and sarcastic and hopeful humorous rebuttals toward clich\u00e9 bohemian ideals that have been exhausted for years.Cobain originally wanted Nevermind to be divided into two sides a Boy side for the songs written about the experiences of his early life and childhood and a Girl side for the songs written about his dysfunctional relationship with Vail\u200a177\u200a Charles R. Cross wrote In the four months following their breakup Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs all of them about Tobi Vail. Though Cobain wrote Lithium before meeting Vail he wrote the lyrics to reference her\u200a168\u2013169\u200a Cobain said in an interview with Musician that he wrote about some of my very personal experiences like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling. Very lonely sick. While Cobain regarded In Utero as for the most part very impersonal its lyrics deal with his parents divorce his newfound fame and the public image and perception of himself and Courtney Love on Serve the Servants with his enamored relationship with Love conveyed through lyrical themes of pregnancy and the female anatomy on HeartShaped Box.\n\nCobain was affected enough to write Polly from Nevermind after reading a newspaper story of an incident in 1987, when a 14-yearold girl was kidnapped after attending a punk rock show then raped and tortured with a blowtorch. She escaped after gaining the trust of her captor Gerald Friend through flirting with him\u200a136\u200a After seeing Nirvana perform Bob Dylan cited Polly as the best of Nirvanas songs and said of Cobain the kid has heart.\u200a137\u200a Patrick S\u00fcskinds novel Perfume The Story of a Murderer inspired Cobain to write the song Scentless Apprentice from In Utero. The book is a historical horror novel about a perfumers apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell and who attempts to create the ultimate perfume by killing virginal women and taking their scentCobain immersed himself in artistic projects throughout his life as much so as he did in songwriting. The sentiments of his artwork followed the same subjects of his lyrics often expressed through a dark and macabre sense of humor. Noted were his fascination with physiology his own rare medical conditions and the human anatomy. According to Novoselic Kurt said that he never liked literal things. He liked cryptic things. He would cut out pictures of meat from grocerystore fliers then paste these orchids on them ... And all this stuff on In Utero about the body  there was something about anatomy. He really liked that. You look at his art  there are these people and theyre all weird like mutants. And dolls  creepy dolls.Cobain contributed backing guitar for a spoken word recording of beat poet William S. Burroughs entitled The Priest They Called Him\u200a301\u200a Cobain regarded Burroughs as a hero. During Nirvanas European tour Cobain kept a copy of Burroughs Naked Lunch purchased from a London bookstall\u200a189\u2013190\u200a Cobain met with Burroughs at his home in Lawrence Kansas in October 1993. Burroughs expressed no surprise at Cobains death It wasnt an act of will for Kurt to kill himself. As far as I was concerned he was dead already.\n\nEquipment\nIn a Guitar World retrospective Cobains guitar tone was deemed one of the most iconic in the history of the electric guitar while noting that rather than relying on expensive or vintage items Cobain used an eccentric cache of budget models lowend imports and pawn shop prizes. Cobain stated in a 1992 interview Junk is always best but denied this was a punk statement and claimed it was a necessity as he had trouble finding high quality lefthanded guitarsCobains first guitar was a used electric guitar from Sears that he received on his 14th birthday. He took guitar lessons long enough to learn ACDCs Back in Black and began playing with local kids. Cobain found the guitar smashed after leaving it in a locker but he was able to purchase new equipment including a Peavey amp by recovering and selling his stepfathers gun collection which his mother had dumped in a river after discovering his infidelity. Upon forming what would be Nirvana Cobain was playing a Fender Champ amplifier and a righthanded Univox HiFlier guitar he flipped over and strung for lefthanded playingFor the recording of Bleach Cobain needed to borrow a Fender Twin Reverb due to his main amplifier a solidstate Randall being repaired at the time but as the Twin Reverbs speakers were blown he was forced to pair it with an external cabinet featuring two 12\" speakers. He used a Boss DS1 for distortion while playing HiFlier guitars which cost him 100 each. Nirvana embarked on their first American tour in 1989, at the start of which Cobain played an Epiphone ET270; however he destroyed the guitar onstage during a show a subsequent habit that forced label Sub Pop to have to call local pawn shops looking for replacement guitars. Cobains first acoustic guitar a Stella 12-string cost him 3121. Cobain strung it with six or sometimes five strings and while the guitars tuners had to be held together with duct tape it sounded good enough that the guitar was later used to record the Nevermind tracks Polly and Something in the Way.Despite receiving a 287,000 advance upon signing with Geffen Records Cobain retained a preference for inexpensive gear. He became a fan of Japanesemade Fender guitars ahead of recording Nevermind due to their slim necks and wide availability in lefthanded orientation. These included several Stratocasters fitted with humbucker pickups in the bridge positions as well as a 1965 Jaguar with DiMarzio pickups and a 1969 Competition Mustang the latter of which Cobain cited as his favorite despite noting Theyre cheap and totally inefficient and they sound like crap and are very small. For the album Cobain used a rackmount system featuring a MesaBoogie Studio preamp a Crown power amp and Marshall cabinets. He also used a Vox AC30 and a Fender Bassman. Producer Butch Vig preferred to avoid pedals but allowed Cobain to use his Boss DS1, which Cobain considered a key part of his sound as well as an ElectroHarmonix Big Muff fuzz pedal and a Small Clone chorus which can be heard on songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit Come As You Are and Aneurysm.Cobain used his 69 Mustang 65 Jaguar a custom JaguarMustang and a HiFlier for the In Utero recording sessions. To tour behind the album Cobain placed an order for 10 Mustangs split between Fiesta Red and Sonic Blue. As the Fender Custom Shop was new the guitars were to be shipped out two at a time over a period of months. By the time of his death Cobain had received six of the guitars. The remaining four waiting to be shipped were instead sold as regular stock at Japanese music stores without informing buyers the guitars had been made for CobainFor Nirvanas Unplugged performance Cobain played a righthanded 1959 Martin D18E acoustic guitar modified for lefthanded playing. The guitar became the most expensive ever sold when it fetched over 6 million at auction in 2020. Cobains 1969 Competition Mustang which he also played in the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video sold at a 2022 auction to Jim Irsay owner of the Indianapolis Colts for 45 million with an original estimate of 600,000.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships and family\nThere are differing accounts of exactly when and how Kurt Cobain first met Courtney Love. In his 1993 authorized biography of Nirvana Michael Azerrad cites a January 21, 1989, Dharma Bums gig in Portland where Nirvana played as support while the Charles R. Cross 2001 Cobain biography has Love and Cobain meeting at the same Satyricon nightclub venue in Portland but a different Nirvana show January 12, 1990,\u200a201\u200a when both still led ardent underground rock bands. Love made advances soon after they met but Cobain was evasive. Early in their interactions Cobain broke off dates and ignored Loves advances because he was unsure if he wanted a relationship. Cobain noted I was determined to be a bachelor for a few months ... But I knew that I liked Courtney so much right away that it was a really hard struggle to stay away from her for so many months.\u200a172\u2013173\u200a Everett True who was an associate of both Cobain and Love disputes those versions of events in his 2006 book claiming that he himself introduced the couple on May 17, 1991Cobain was already aware of Love through her role in the 1987 film Straight to Hell. According to True the pair were formally introduced at an L7 and Butthole Surfers concert in Los Angeles in May 1991. In the weeks that followed after learning from Grohl that Cobain shared mutual interests with her Love began pursuing Cobain. In late 1991, the two were often together and bonded through drug use\u200a172\u200aOn February 24, 1992, a few days after the conclusion of Nirvanas Pacific Rim tour Cobain and Love were married on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by Frances Farmer and Cobain donned a Guatemalan purse and wore green pajamas because he had been too lazy to put on a tux. Eight people were in attendance at the ceremony including Grohl. Love said she was warned by the Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon that marrying Cobain would destroy her life Love responded Whatever! I love him and I want to be with him! ... It wasnt his fault. He wasnt trying to do that.The couples daughter Frances Bean Cobain was born August 18, 1992. A sonogram was included in the artwork for Nirvanas single Lithium. In a 1992 Vanity Fair article Love admitted to a drug binge with Cobain in the early weeks of her pregnancy. At the time she claimed that Vanity Fair had misquoted her. Love later admitted to using heroin before knowing she was pregnant. The couple were asked by the press if Frances was addicted to drugs at birth. The Los Angeles County Department of Childrens Services visited the Cobains days after Love gave birth and later took them to court stating that their drug usage made them unfit parents.\n\nSexuality\nIn October 1992, when asked Well are you gay? by Monk Magazine Cobain replied If I wasnt attracted to Courtney Id be a bisexual. In another interview he described identifying with the gay community in The Advocate stating Im definitely gay in spirit and I probably could be bisexual and if I wouldnt have found Courtney I probably would have carried on with a bisexual lifestyle but also that he was more sexually attracted to women. He described himself as being feminine in childhood and often wore dresses and other stereotypically feminine clothing. Some of his song lyrics as well as phrases he would use to vandalize vehicles and a bank included God is gay Jesus is gay HOMOSEXUAL SEX RULES and Everyone is gay. One of his personal journals states I am not gay although I wish I were just to piss off homophobes.Cobain advocated for LGBTQ rights including traveling to Oregon to perform at a benefit opposing the 1992 Oregon Ballot Measure 9, and supported local bands with LGBTQ members. He reported having felt different from the age of seven and was a frequent target of homophobic bullying in his school due to his having a gay friend. Cobain was interviewed by two gay magazines Out and The Advocate the 1993 interview with The Advocate being described as the only interview the bands lead singer says he plans to do for Incesticide an album whose liner notes included a statement decrying homophobia racism and misogyny\nIf any of you in any way hate homosexuals people of different color or women please do this one favor for usleave us the fuck alone! Dont come to our shows and dont buy our records.\n\nHealth and addiction\nThroughout most of his life Cobain had chronic bronchitis and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition\u200a66\u200a According to The Telegraph Cobain had depression. His cousin brought attention to the family history of suicide mental illness and alcoholism noting that two of her uncles had died by suicide with gunsHe used drugs heavily his first drug experience was with cannabis in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood\u200a76\u200a Cobain also had a period of consuming notable amounts of LSD as observed by Marander\u200a75\u200a and was prone to alcoholism and solvent abuse. Novoselic said he was really into getting fucked up drugs acid any kind of drug.\u200a76\u200a Cobain first took heroin in 1986, administered to him by a dealer in Tacoma Washington who had previously supplied him with oxycodone and aspirin\u200a41\u200a Cobain used heroin sporadically for several years by the end of 1990, his use had developed into addiction. Cobain claimed that he was determined to get a habit as a way to selfmedicate his stomach condition. It started with three days in a row of doing heroin and I dont have a stomach pain. That was such a relief he said\u200a236\u200a However his longtime friend Buzz Osborne disputes this saying that his stomach pain was more likely caused by his heroin use He made it up for sympathy and so he could use it as an excuse to stay loaded. Of course he was vomitingthats what people on heroin do they vomit. Its called vomiting with a smile on your face.Cobains heroin use began to affect Nirvanas Nevermind tour. During a 1992 photoshoot with Michael Lavine he fell asleep several times having used heroin beforehand. Cobain told biographer Michael Azerrad Theyre not going to be able to tell me to stop. So I really didnt care. Obviously to them it was like practicing witchcraft or something. They didnt know anything about it so they thought that any second I was going to die.\u200a241\u200aThe morning after the bands performance on Saturday Night Live in 1992, Cobain experienced his first neardeath overdose after injecting heroin Love resuscitated him. Prior to a performance at the New Music Seminar in New York City on July 23, 1993, Cobain suffered another overdose. Rather than calling for an ambulance Love injected Cobain with naloxone to resuscitate him. Cobain proceeded to perform with Nirvana giving the public no indication that anything had happened\u200a296\u2013297\n\nDeath\nFollowing a tour stop at Terminal Eins in Munich Germany on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment and was joined there by his wife Courtney Love on March 3. The next morning Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain was rushed to the hospital and was unconscious for the rest of the day. After five days Cobain was released and returned to Seattle. Love later said that the incident was Cobains first suicide attemptOn March 18, 1994, Love phoned the Seattle police informing them that Cobain was suicidal and had locked himself in a room with a gun. Police arrived and confiscated several guns and a bottle of pills from Cobain who insisted that he was not suicidal and had locked himself in the room to hide from LoveLove arranged an intervention regarding Cobains drug use on March 25, 1994. The ten people involved included musician friends record company executives and one of Cobains closest friends Dylan Carlson. Cobain reacted with anger insulting and heaping scorn on the participants and locked himself in the upstairs bedroom. However by the end of the day Cobain agreed to undergo a detox program and he entered a residential facility in Los Angeles for a few days on March 30, 1994The following night Cobain left the facility and flew to Seattle. On the flight he sat near Duff McKagan of Guns N Roses. Despite Cobains animosity towards Guns N Roses Cobain seemed happy to see McKagan. McKagan later said that he knew from all of my instincts that something was wrong.\u200a331\u200a Most of Cobains friends and family were unaware of his whereabouts. On April 7, amid rumors of Nirvana breaking up the band pulled out of the 1994 Lollapalooza festival.\nOn April 8, Cobains body was discovered at his Lake Washington Boulevard home by an electrician who had arrived to install a security system. A suicide note was found addressed to Cobains childhood imaginary friend Boddah that stated that Cobain had not felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with really writing ... for too many years now. Cobains body had been there for days the coroners report estimated he died on April 5, 1994, at the age of 27.\n\nAftermath\nA public vigil was held on April 10, at a park at Seattle Center drawing approximately 7,000 mourners\u200a346\u200a Prerecorded messages by Novoselic and Love were played at the memorial. Love read portions of the suicide note to the crowd crying and chastising Cobain. Near the end of the vigil Love distributed some of Cobains clothing to those who remained\u200a350\u200a Grohl said that the news of Cobains death was probably the worst thing that has happened to me in my life. I remember the day after that I woke up and I was heartbroken that he was gone. I just felt like Okay so I get to wake up today and have another day and he doesnt.Billboard reporting from Seattle on April 23, stated that within a few hours of Cobains death being confirmed on April 8, the only remaining Nirvana titles at Park Ave Records on Queen Anne Avenue were two HeartShaped Box import CD singles. A marketing director at the threestore Cellophane Square chain said that all three stores sold about a few hundred CDs singles and vinyl by the morning of April 9\". A buyer at Tower Records on Mercer Street said Its a pathetic scene everything is going out the door. If people were really fans they wouldve had this stuff already. In the United Kingdom sales of Nirvana releases rose dramatically immediately after Cobains deathGrohl believed that he knew Cobain would die at an early age saying that sometimes you just cant save someone from themselves and in some ways you kind of prepare yourself emotionally for that to be a reality. Dave Reed who for a short time had been Cobains foster father said that he had the desperation not the courage to be himself. Once you do that you cant go wrong because you cant make any mistakes when people love you for being yourself. But for Kurt it didnt matter that other people loved him he simply didnt love himself enough.\u200a351\u200a\nA final ceremony was arranged by Cobains mother on May 31, 1999, and was attended by Love and Tracy Marander. As a Buddhist monk chanted daughter Frances Bean scattered Cobains ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia the city where he had found his true artistic muse.\u200a351\u200a In 2006, Love said she retained Cobains ashes kept in a bank vault in Los Angeles because no cemetery in Seattle will take them. Cobains death became a topic of public fascination and debate. His artistic endeavors and struggles with addiction illness and depression as well as the circumstances of his death have become a frequent topic of controversy. According to a spokesperson for the Seattle Police Department the department receives at least one weekly request to reopen the investigation resulting in the maintenance of the basic incident report on fileIn March 2014, the Seattle police developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault no reason was provided for why the rolls were not developed earlier. According to the Seattle police the 35mm film photographs show the scene of Cobains dead body more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski a cold case investigator was instructed to look at the film because it is 20 years later and its a high media case. Ciesynski stated that Cobains death remains a suicide and that the images would not have been released publicly. The photos in question were later released one by one weeks before the 20th anniversary of Cobains death. One photo shows Cobains arm still wearing the hospital bracelet from the drug rehab facility he had left just a few days prior to returning to Seattle. Another photo shows Cobains foot resting next to a bag of shotgun shells one of which was used in his death.\n\nLegacy\nCobain is remembered as one of the most influential rock musicians in the history of alternative music. His angstfueled songwriting and antiestablishment persona led him to be referenced as the spokesman of Generation X. In addition Cobains songs widened the themes of mainstream rock music of the 1980s to discussion of personal reflection and social issues. On April 10, 2014, Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Grohl Novoselic and Love accepted the accolade at the ceremony where Cobain was also remembered. Cobain is one of the bestknown members of the 27 Club a list of musicians who died when they were 27 years old.\nMusic  Media reporting on April 23, 1994, after Cobain had died stated that Jorgen Larsen the president of MCA Music Entertainment International was asked where he thought Cobain stood in terms of his contribution to contemporary music and Larsen replied that If anybody comes out of nowhere to sell 11 or 12 million albums you have to conclude that theres something there. He wasnt just a onehit wonder.According to music journalist Paul Lester who worked at Melody Maker at the time Cobains suicide triggered an immediate reappraisal of his work. He wrote The general impression offered by In Utero was that Cobain was some kind of whiny selfabsorbed grunge misery guts who could make routinely powerful music but was hardly a suffering godhead. You could almost hear a collective sigh of relief after April 5, 1994, that Cobain could no longer further sully his reputation that the mythmaking machinery could finally be cranked into action.Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins referred to Cobain as the Michael Jordan of our generation and said that Cobain opened the door for everyone in the 1990s alternative rock scene. Lars Ulrich of Metallica reflected on Cobains influence stating that with Kurt Cobain you felt you were connecting to the real person not to a perception of who he was  you were not connecting to an image or a manufactured cutout. You felt that between you and him there was nothing  it was hearttoheart. There are very few people who have that ability. In 1996, the Church of Kurt Cobain was established in Portland Oregon but it was later claimed by some media outlets to have been a media hoax. Reflecting on Cobains death over 10 years later MSNBCs Eric Olsen wrote In the intervening decade Cobain a small frail but handsome man in life has become an abstract Generation X icon viewed by many as the last real rock star ... a messiah and martyr whose every utterance has been plundered and parsed.In 2003, David Fricke of Rolling Stone ranked Cobain the 12th greatest guitarist of all time. He was later ranked the 73rd greatest guitarist and 45th greatest singer of all time by the same magazine and by MTV as seventh in the 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2006, he was placed at number twenty by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Singers of All Time.\nIn 2005, a sign was put up in Aberdeen Washington that read Welcome to Aberdeen  Come As You Are as a tribute to Cobain. The sign was paid for and created by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee a nonprofit organization created in May 2004 to honor Cobain. The Committee planned to create a Kurt Cobain Memorial Park and a youth center in Aberdeen. Because Cobain was cremated and his remains scattered into the Wishkah River in Washington many Nirvana fans visit Viretta Park near Cobains former Lake Washington home to pay tribute. On the anniversary of his death fans gather in the park to celebrate his life and memory. Controversy erupted in July 2009 when a monument to Cobain in Aberdeen along the Wishkah River included the quote ... Drugs are bad for you. They will fuck you up. The city ultimately decided to sandblast the monument to replace the expletive with f but fans immediately drew the letters back in. In December 2013, the small city of Hoquiam where Cobain once lived announced that April 10 would become the annual Nirvana Day. Similarly in January 2014, Cobains birthday February 20, was declared annual Kurt Cobain Day in AberdeenIn June 2020, the 1959 Martin D18E acousticelectric guitar used by Cobain for Nirvanas MTV Unplugged performance sold at auction for 6,010,000 to Peter Freedman the chairman of R\u00f8de Microphones. It was the most expensive guitar and the most expensive piece of band memorabilia ever sold. In May 2022, Cobains Lake Placid Blue Fender Mustang guitar sold at auction for 45 million to Jim Irsay making it the secondmost valuable guitar ever sold and the most valuable electric guitarIn July 2021, the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation confirmed that Cobains childhood home in Aberdeen would be included on their Heritage Register and that the owner would be making it into an exhibit for people to visit.\n\nMedia\nBooks\nPrior to Cobains death Michael Azerrad published Come as You Are The Story of Nirvana a book chronicling Nirvanas career from its beginning as well as the personal histories of the band members. The book explored Cobains drug addiction as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobains death Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobains life. The book involved the band members themselves who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrads taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain titled Kurt Cobain About a Son. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.\nJournalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobains death in their 1998 book Who Killed Kurt Cobain. Halperin and Wallace argued that while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. The book included the journalists discussions with Tom Grant who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Loves employ. Over the next several years Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book 2004's Love and Death The Murder of Kurt Cobain.\nIn 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain titled Heavier Than Heaven. For the book Cross conducted over 400 interviews and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobains journals lyrics and diaries. Cross biography was met with criticism including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand and incorrect information as fact. Friend Everett True  who derided the book as being inaccurate omissive and highly biased  said Heavier than Heaven was the Courtneysanctioned version of history or alternatively Crosss Oh I think I need to find the new Bruce Springsteen now Kurt Cobain book. However beyond the criticism the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvanas career that would have otherwise been unnoted. In 2008, Cross published Cobain Unseen a compilation of annotated photographs and creations and writings by Cobain throughout his life and careerIn 2002, a sampling of Cobains writings was published as Journals. The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically although Cobain generally did not date them. The journal pages are reproduced in color and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road made lists of what music he was enjoying and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words but were disturbed by what was viewed as an invasion of his privacyIn 2019, on the 25th anniversary of Cobains death former Nirvana manager Danny Goldberg published Serving the Servant Remembering Kurt Cobain. In promotion of the book Goldberg stated\n\nI think that in terms of icons Kurt was kind of the last icon of the rock era and then the hiphop era started.\nThen obviously in our kids generation hiphop has been a dominant voice for adolescence. Its not the only one  there were still rock artists but not only was he iconic in terms of depth in which he touched people that music was pop. Those songs were as big as Rihanna Travis Scott or Justin Bieber or anything today.\nThey were pop hits as well as touching the underground culture. That fusion of pop and underground I dont think rock has produced someone else who could do that since Kurt. I think hes arguably the last of that era.\n\nYou could almost have bookends of an era that started with The Beatles and ended with Kurt. I mean yeah there was rock and roll before The Beatles but The Beatles broadened it and I think you can make that argument.\n\nFilm and television\nIn the 1998 documentary Kurt  Courtney filmmaker Nick Broomfield investigated Tom Grants claim that Cobain was actually murdered. He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love Loves father Cobains aunt and one of the couples former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to Mentors bandleader Eldon El Duce Hoke who claimed Love offered him 50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain he failed to mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hokes last interview as he died days later reportedly hit by a train. However Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview Broomfield summed it up by saying\n\nI think that he committed suicide. I dont think theres a smoking gun. And I think theres only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on and he was expendable.\nBroomfields documentary was noted by The New York Times to be a rambling largely speculative and circumstantial work relying on flimsy evidence as was his later documentary Biggie  TupacThe documentary Teen Spirit The Tribute to Kurt Cobain was released in July 1994 as a home video rereleased in 1996, and on DVD in 2001. The Vigil is a 1998 comedy film about a group of young people who travel from Lethbridge Alberta Canada to Seattle in the United States to attend the memorial vigil for Cobain in 1994. It stars Donny Lucas and Trevor WhiteGus Van Sant loosely based his 2005 movie Last Days on the events in the final days of Cobains life starring Michael Pitt as the main character Blake who was based on CobainIn 2006, the Jon Brewer directed documentary All Apologies Kurt Cobain 10 Years On and the BBC documentary The Last 48 Hours of Kurt Cobain were released. In January 2007, Love began to shop the biography Heavier Than Heaven to various movie studios in Hollywood to turn the book into an Alist feature film about Cobain and NirvanaA Brett Morgen film entitled Kurt Cobain Montage of Heck premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015, followed by smallscreen and cinema releases. Morgen said that documentary will be this generations The Wall.Soaked in Bleach is a 2015 American docudrama directed by Benjamin Statler. The film details the events leading up to the death of Kurt Cobain as seen through the perspective of Tom Grant the private detective who was hired by Courtney Love to find Cobain her husband shortly before his death in 1994. It also explores the premise that Cobains death was not a suicide. The film stars Tyler Bryan as Cobain and Daniel Roebuck as Grant with Sarah Scott portraying Courtney Love and August Emerson as Dylan Carlson. Loves legal team issued a ceaseanddesist letter against theaters showing the documentaryRegarding the depiction of Nirvana and in particular Kurt Cobain the indie rock author Andrew Earles wrote\n\nNever has a rock bands past been so retroactively distorted into an irreversible fiction by incessant mythologizing conjecture wild speculation and romanticizing rhetoric. The Cobain biographical narrative  specifically in regard to the culturally irresponsible mishandling of subjects such as drug abuse depression and suicide  is now impenetrable with inaccurate and overcooked connectivity between that which is completely unrelated too chronologically disparate or just plain untrueMatt Reeves film The Batman depicts a version of Bruce Wayne performed by Robert Pattinson that was loosely inspired by Cobain. Reeves stated when I write I listen to music and as I was writing the first act I put on Nirvanas Something in the Way thats when it came to me that rather than make Bruce Wayne the playboy version weve seen before theres another version who had gone through a great tragedy and become a recluse. So I started making this connection to Gus Van Sants Last Days and the idea of this fictionalised version of Kurt Cobain being in this kind of decaying manor. Something in the Way was used in trailers to promote The Batman prior to its release and is featured twice in the filmTo mark the 30th anniversary of Cobains death a new documentary titled Kurt Cobain Moments That Shook Music will air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer on April 13, 2024.\n\nTheatre\nIn September 2009, the Roy Smiles play Kurt and Sid debuted at the Trafalgar Studios in Londons West End. The play set in Cobains greenhouse on the day of his suicide revolves around the ghost of Sid Vicious visiting Cobain to try to convince him not to kill himself. Cobain was played by Shaun Evans.\n\nVideo games\nCobain was included as a playable character in the 2009 video game Guitar Hero 5; he can be used to play songs by Nirvana and other acts. Novoselic and Grohl released a statement condemning the inclusion and urging the developer Activision to alter it saying they had no control over the use of Cobains likeness. Love denied that she had given permission saying it was the result of a cabal of a few assholes greed and threatened to sue. The vicepresident of Activision said that Love had contributed photos and videos to the development and had been great to work with.\n\nDiscography\nNirvana\nFor a complete list of all Nirvana releases see Nirvana discography\n\nBleach 1989)\nNevermind 1991)\nIn Utero 1993)\n\nPosthumous albums\nPosthumous singles\nPosthumous videos\nKurt Cobain Montage of Heck DVD and Bluray 2015)\n\nCollaborations\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKurt Cobain discography at Discogs \nKurt Cobain at AllMusic\nKurt Cobain at IMDb\nThe Kurt Cobain Equipment FAQ info on his guitars amplifiers  effects\nOfficial police reports into Cobains death at The Smoking Gun", "Mark Freuder Knopfler  born 12 August 1949) is a British guitarist singer songwriter and record producer.

Knopfler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.\n\nBiography\n1949\u20131976: Early life\nMark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in Glasgow Scotland to an English mother Louisa Mary n\u00e9e Laidler and a Hungarian Jewish father Erwin Knopfler. His mother was a teacher and his father was an architect and a chess player who left his native Hungary in 1939 to flee the Nazis. Knopfler later described his father as a Marxist agnosticThe Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area where Marks younger brother David was born on 27 December 1952. Marks older sister Ruth was born in Newcastle where Marks parents were married in 1947. The family moved to Knopflers mothers hometown of Blyth near Newcastle in North East England when he was seven years old. Mark had attended Bearsden Primary School in Scotland for two years both brothers attended Gosforth Grammar School in Newcastle.\nOriginally inspired by his uncle Kingsleys harmonica and boogiewoogie piano playing Mark soon became familiar with many different styles of music. Although he hounded his father for an expensive Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster electric guitar just like Hank Marvins he eventually bought a twinpickup H\u00f6fner Super Solid for 50 equivalent to 1,225 in 2021).In 1963, when he was 13, he took a Saturday job at the Newcastle Evening Chronicle newspaper earning six shillings and sixpence. Here he met the ageing poet Basil Bunting who was a copy editor. The two had little to say to each other but in 2015, Knopfler wrote a track in tribute to himAt this time Knopfler got around the country largely by hitchhiking and also hitched through Europe a number of timesDuring the 1960s he formed and joined several bands and listened to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins Scotty Moore BB King Django Reinhardt Hank Marvin and James Burton. At the age of 16, he made a local television appearance as part of a harmony duo with his classmate Sue HercombeIn 1968, after studying journalism for a year at Harlow College Knopfler was hired as a junior reporter in Leeds for the Yorkshire Evening Post. During this time he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer country blues enthusiast and parttime performer Steve Phillips one year his senior from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles. The two formed a duo called The Duolian String Pickers which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues. Two years later Knopfler decided to further his education and later graduated with a degree in English at the University of LeedsIn April 1970, while living in Leeds he recorded a demo disc of an original song he had written Summers Coming My Way. The recording included Knopfler guitar and vocals Steve Phillips second guitar Dave Johnson bass and Paul Granger percussion. Johnson Granger and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits The Notting Hillbillies.\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in High Wycombe called Brewers Droop appearing on the album The Booze Brothers. One night while spending time with friends the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extralight strings to make it usable. Even so he found it impossible to play unless he fingerpicked it leading to the development of his signature playing style. He said in a later interview That was where I found my voice on guitar. After a brief stint with Brewers Droop Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at Loughton College in Essex  a position he held for three years. Throughout this time he continued performing with local pub bands including the Caf\u00e9 RacersBy the mid1970s Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group the Caf\u00e9 Racers. His brother David moved to London where he shared a flat with John Illsley a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in Buckhurst Hill and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together and soon Mark invited John to join the Caf\u00e9 Racers.\n\n1977\u20131995: Dire Straits\nDire Straits first demos were recorded in three sessions in 1977, with David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist John Illsley as bass guitarist and Pick Withers as drummer. On 27 July 1977, they recorded the demo tapes of five songs Wild West End Sultans of Swing Down to the Waterline Sacred Loving a David Knopfler song and Water of Love. They later recorded Southbound Again In the Gallery and Six Blade Knife for BBC Radio Londonand finally on 9 November made demo tapes of Setting Me Up Eastbound Train and Real Girl. Many of these songs reflect Knopflers experiences in Newcastle Leeds and London and were featured on their first album the eponymous Dire Straits which was released in the following year Down to the Waterline recalled images of life in Newcastle In The Gallery is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips father of Steve Phillips and Lions Wild West End and Eastbound Train were all drawn from Knopflers early days in the capitalOn its initial release in October 1978, the album Dire Straits received little fanfare in the UK but when Sultans of Swing was released as a single it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off  first across Europe and then in the United States and Canada and finally the UK. The groups second album Communiqu\u00e9 produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett followed in June 1979.\nTheir third album Making Movies released in October 1980, moved towards more complex arrangements and production which continued for the remainder of the groups career. The album included many of Mark Knopflers most personal compositions most notably Romeo and Juliet and Tunnel of Love with its intro The Carousel Waltz by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II which also featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film An Officer and a Gentleman. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits from 1980 onwards with Mark Knopfler and John Illsley the only members to remain throughout the groups 18 year existence. In 1980 whilst the recording sessions for Making Movies were taking place tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career. The remaining trio continued the album with Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteens E Street Band guesting on keyboards and session guitarist Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar although he was uncredited on the album. After the recording sessions were completed keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as fulltime members for the On Location tour of Europe North America and OceaniaIn September 1982, the groups fourth studio album Love Over Gold was released. This featured the tracks Private Investigations Telegraph Road Industrial Disease It Never Rains and the title track of the album Love Over Gold. Shortly after the albums release Pick Withers left the band.\nIn early 1983, with Love Over Gold still in the albums charts the band released a foursong EP titled ExtendedancEPlay. Featuring the hit single Twisting by the Pool this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams formerly of Rockpile and Man. An eight month long Love over Gold Tour followed which finished with two soldout concerts at Londons Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. In March 1984 the double album Alchemy Live was released which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in VHS video and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart and was reissued in DVD and Bluray format in 2010.\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams played on Phil Everlys and Cliff Richards song She Means Nothing To Me which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1983, taken from the album Phil Everly. Knopfler had also expressed his interest writing film music and after producer David Puttnam responded he wrote and produced the music score to the film Local Hero. The album was released in April 1983 and received a BAFTA award nomination for Best Score for a Film the following year. Alan Clark also contributed and other Dire Straits members Illsley Lindes and Williams played on one track Freeway Flyer and Gerry Rafferty contributed lead vocals on The Way It Always Starts. The closing track on the album and on the credits in the film is the instrumental Going Home Theme of the Local Hero which was released as a single and became a popular live staple for Dire Straits entering the bands repertoire from 1983 onwards.Local Hero was followed in 1984 by Knopflers music scores for the films Cal soundtrack and Comfort and Joy both of which also featured Terry Williams as well as keyboardist Guy Fletcher. Also during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylans Infidels album as well as Knife by Aztec Camera. He also wrote the song Private Dancer for Tina Turners comeback album of the same name to which other Dire Straits members John Illsley Alan Clark Hal Lindes and Terry Williams contributed. Knopfler also contributed lead guitar to Bryan Ferrys album Boys and Girls released in June 1985.\n\nDire Straits biggest studio album by far was their fifth Brothers in Arms. Recording of the album started at the end of 1984 at George Martins Air Studios in Montserrat with Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman producing. There were further personnel changes. Guy Fletcher joined the band as a full time member so the group now had two keyboardists while second guitarist Hal Lindes left the band early on during the recording sessions and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni a New Yorkbased guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler although Sonnis contribution to the album was minimal. The then permanent drummer Terry Williams was released from the recording sessions after the first month and temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim who rerecorded the albums drum parts within three days before leaving for other commitments. Williams would be back in the band as a full time member for the music videos and the 1985\u20131986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followedReleased in May 1985, Brothers in Arms became an international blockbuster that has now sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and is the fourth best selling album in UK chart history. Brothers in Arms spawned several chart singles including the US  1 hit Money for Nothing which was the first video played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format as it was also one of the first DDD CDs ever released Other successful singles were So Far Away Walk of Life and the albums title track. The band embarked on a 1985\u20131986 Brothers in Arms world tour of over 230 shows which was immensely successful.\nAfter the Brothers in Arms world tour Dire Straits ceased to work together for some time Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble Ferry Aid on Let It Be in the wake of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The song reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in March 1987. Knopfler wrote the music score for the film The Princess Bride released at the end of 1987.\nMark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit featured on the French and Saunders Show titled The Easy Guitar Book Sketch with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians David Gilmour Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead Mark King from Level 42, and Gary Moore. Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmours guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skitDire Straits regrouped for 11 June 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in which they were the headline act and were accompanied by Elton John and Eric Clapton who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. Jack Sonni and Terry Williams both officially left the band shortly afterwards. In September 1988 Mark Knopfler announced the official dissolution of Dire Straits saying that he needed a rest. In October 1988, a compilation album Money for Nothing was released and reached number one in the United KingdomIn 1989, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum. It leaned heavily towards American roots music  folk blues and country music. The band members included keyboardist Guy Fletcher with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. For both the album and the tour Paul Franklin was added to the lineup on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album Missing..Presumed Having a Good Time was released in 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with Chet Atkins Neck and Neck which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this lowkey tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.\n\nIn 1990, Knopfler John Illsley and Alan Clark performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth joined by Eric Clapton Ray Cooper and guitarist Phil Palmer who was at that time part of Eric Claptons touring band and in January the following year Knopfler John Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler Illsley Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by sidemen Phil Palmer pedal steel guitarist Paul Franklin percussionist Danny Cummings and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro.\nThe followup to Brothers in Arms was finally released in September 1991. On Every Street was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor and met with a mixed critical reaction with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a sixyear break. Nonetheless the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer Chris Whitten joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling world tour featuring 300 shows in front of some 71 million ticketbuying fans. This was to be Dire Straits final world tour it was not as well received as the previous Brothers in Arms tour and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager Ed Bicknell is quoted as saying The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of it had passed. John Illsley agreed saying Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody emotionally and physically. We were changed by it. This drove the band into the ground and ultimately led to the groups final dissolution in 1995.\nFollowing the tour Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released both live albums. On the Night released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits final world tour. In 1995, following the release of Live at the BBC a contractual release to Vertigo Records Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist. Knopfler later recalled that I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. Its selfprotection a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing. Knopfler would spend two years recovering from the experience which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.\nSince the breakup of Dire Straits Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopflers solo material to date while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently playing on three of Knopflers solo album releases All the Roadrunning with Emmylou Harris Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky. In October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform. Illsley said that a reunion would be entirely up to Mark however he also observed that Knopfler was enjoying his success as a solo artist. When asked about a possible reunion Knopfler responded Oh I dont know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again and that the global fame Dire Straits achieved in the 1980s just got too big.In 2018, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Knopfler did not attend the induction ceremony however remaining members John Illsley Guy Fletcher and Alan Clark were in attendance to accept the award on behalf of the band.\nIn November 2021 John Illsley published his autobiography My Life in Dire Straits in which he confirms that Knopfler has no interest in reforming Dire Straits which he again reiterated in an interview in November 2023. He reflected that the band members had reached the end of the road after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was pretty happy when the bands run came to an end recalling feeling mentally physically and emotionally exhausted by the time Dire Straits disbanded. At the time Illsley also said I can openly admit to you that I really enjoyed the success of the band Im speaking for Mark as well we both really enjoyed it. It comes with a certain amount of stress obviously. Youve got to really dig deep sometimes to keep it working. I think Mark said  and I hope Im quoting him correctly here  but he said that success is great but fame is what comes out of the exhaust pipe of a car. Its something you dont really want.Dire Straits remain one of the most popular British rock bands as well as one of the worlds most commercially successful bands with worldwide album sales of more than 120 million.\n\n1996\u2013present Solo career\nKnopflers first solo album Golden Heart was released in March 1996. It featured the UK single Darling Pretty. The albums recording sessions helped create Knopflers backing band which is also known as The 96ers. It features Knopflers old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This bands main lineup has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits lineup. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christophers Dunblane massacre tribute cover Knockin on Heavens Door.\nKnopfler composed his first film score in 1983 for Local Hero. In 1997, Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie Wag the Dog.

This has been his most successful to date possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album like Van Morrison. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the Music for Montserrat concert at the Royal Albert Hall London performing alongside artists such as Sting Phil Collins Elton John Eric Clapton and Paul McCartneyIn July 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts under the name of Mark Knopfler and friends with former Dire Straits members John Illsley Chris White Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher playing old material from the Dire Straits years. The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. At these four concerts three of the four were at the Shepherds Bush the fourth at Beaulieu on the south coast they were joined by Jimmy Nail who provided backing vocals for Knopflers 2002 composition Why Aye Man.\nAlso in 2002, Knopfler released his third solo album The Ragpickers Dream. In March 2003 he was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road Belgravia and suffered a broken collarbone broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs. The planned Ragpickers Dream tour was subsequently cancelled but Knopfler recovered and returned to the stage in 2004 for his fourth album ShangriLa.\n\nShangriLa was recorded at the ShangriLa Studio in Malibu California in 2004, where the Band had made recordings years before for their documentarymovie The Last Waltz. In the promo for ShangriLa on his official website he said his current lineup of Glenn Worf bass Guy Fletcher keyboards Chad Cromwell drums Richard Bennett guitar and Matt Rollings piano ...play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did. The ShangriLa tour took Knopfler to countries such as India and the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In India his concerts at Mumbai and Bangalore were well received with over 20,000 fans at each concert.\nIn November 2005 a compilation Private Investigations The Best of Dire Straits  Mark Knopfler was released consisting of material from most of Dire Straits studio albums and Knopflers solo and soundtrack material. The album was released in two editions as a single CD with a grey cover and as a double CD with the cover in blue and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is All the Roadrunning a duet with country music singer Emmylou Harris which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.\nReleased in April 2006, All the Roadrunning reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland No. 2 in Norway and Sweden No. 3 in Germany The Netherlands and Italy No. 8 in Austria and UK No. 9 in Spain No. 17 in the United States Billboard Top 200 Chart No. 25 in Ireland and No. 41 in Australia.

The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard European Album chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Rock Album chart.\nKnopflers solo live performances can be characterised as relaxedalmost workmanlike. He uses very little stage production other than some lighting effects to enhance the musics dynamics. He has been known to sip tea on stage during live performances. Richard Bennett who has been playing with him on tour since 1996, has also joined in drinking tea with him on stage. On 31 July 2005, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver BC the tea was replaced with whisky as a last show of tour sort of jokeIn February 2009, Knopfler gave an intimate solo concert at the Garrick Club in London.

In its review of Dire Straits Brothers in Arms in 1985, Spin commented Mark Knopfler may be the most lyrical of all rock guitarists. In the same year Rolling Stone commended his evocative guitar style. According to Classic Rock in 2018, The bareboned economy of Knopflers songs and his dizzying guitar fills were a breath of clean air amid the lumbering rock dinosaurs and onedimensional punk thrashers of the late 70s. He was peerless as craftsman and virtuoso able to plug into rocks classic lineage and bend it to sometimes wild forms. He wrote terrific songs too taut minidramas of dark depths and dazzling melodic and lyrical flourishes. Knopfler is also well known for playing fingerstyle exclusively something he attributed to Chet Atkins.\n\nPersonal life\nKnopfler has been married three times first to Kathy White his longtime girlfriend from school days.

Known as the King of Rock and Roll he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presleys energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations brought both great success and initial controversy.\nPresley was born in Tupelo Mississippi his family relocated to Memphis Tennessee when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips who wanted to bring the sound of AfricanAmerican music to a wider audience. Presley on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black was a pioneer of rockabilly an uptempo backbeatdriven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presleys classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker who would manage him for more than two decades. Presleys first RCA Victor single Heartbreak Hotel was released in January 1956 and became a numberone hit in the United States. Within a year RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and charttopping records Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll though his performative style and promotion of the thenmarginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral wellbeing of white American youthIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts however and guided by Parker proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums most of them critically derided. Some of Presleys most famous films included Jailhouse Rock 1957) Blue Hawaii 1961) and Viva Las Vegas 1964). In 1968, following a sevenyear break from live performances he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special Elvis which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world Aloha from Hawaii. However years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\nHaving sold more than 500 million records worldwide Presley is one of the bestselling music artists of all time. He was commercially successful in many genres including pop country rockabilly rhythm and blues adult contemporary and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He also holds several records including the most RIAAcertified gold and platinum albums the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most numberone albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart and the most numberone singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nLife and career\n1935\u20131953: early years\nElvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo Mississippi to Vernon Presley and Gladys Love n\u00e9e Smith Presley. Elvis twin Jesse Garon was delivered stillborn. Presley became close to both parents especially his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church where he found his initial musical inspiration. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938 they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and jailed for eight monthsIn September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated where his teachers regarded him as average. His first public performance was a singing contest at the MississippiAlabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang Old Shep and recalled placing fifth. A few months later Presley received his first guitar for his birthday he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the familys church. Presley recalled I took the guitar and I watched people and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.In September 1946, Presley entered a new school Milam for sixth grade. The following year he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a trashy kid who played hillbilly music. Presley was a devotee of Mississippi Slims radio show. He was described as crazy about music by Slims younger brother one of Presleys classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques. When his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was 12, Slim scheduled him for two onair performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following weekIn November 1948, the family moved to Memphis Tennessee. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School Presley received a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me. He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates for being a mamas boy. In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Lee Denson a neighbor. They and three other boys including two future rockabilly pioneers brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnetteformed a loose musical collective.\nDuring his junior year Presley began to stand out among his classmates largely because of his appearance he grew his sideburns and styled his hair. He would head down to Beale Street the heart of Memphis thriving blues scene and admire the wild flashy clothes at Lansky Brothers. By his senior year he was wearing those clothes. He competed in Humes Annual Minstrel Show in 1953, singing and playing Till I Waltz Again with You a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation I wasnt popular in school ... I failed musiconly thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.\nPresley who could not read music played by ear and frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths. He knew all of Hank Snows songs and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff Ernest Tubb Ted Daffan Jimmie Rodgers Jimmie Davis and Bob Wills. The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess one of his favorite performers was a significant influence on his balladsinging style. Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly AllNight Singings downtown where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals. Presley listened to regional radio stations such as WDIA that played what were then called race records spirituals blues and the modern backbeatheavy rhythm and blues. Like some of his peers he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences. Many of his future recordings were inspired by local AfricanAmerican musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas. BB. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street. By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.\n\n1953\u20131956: first recordings\nSam Phillips and Sun Records\nIn August 1953, Presley checked into Memphis Recording Service the company run by Sam Phillips before he started Sun Records. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a twosided acetate disc My Happiness and Thats When Your Heartaches Begin. He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother or that he was merely interested in what he sounded like. Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at SunIll Never Stand in Your Way and It Wouldnt Be the Same Without Youbut again nothing came of it. Not long after he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet the Songfellows and another for the band of Eddie Bond.\n\nPhillips meanwhile was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. In June he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad Without You that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians guitarist Winfield Scotty Moore and upright bass player Bill Black to work with Presley for a recording session. The session held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home Presley launched into a 1946 blues number Arthur Crudups Thats All Right. Moore recalled All of a sudden Elvis just started singing this song jumping around and acting the fool and then Bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too and I started playing with them. Phillips quickly began taping this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips no relation to Sam Phillips played Thats All Right on his Red Hot and Blue show. Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley onair Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black. During the next few days the trio recorded a bluegrass song Bill Monroes Blue Moon of Kentucky again in a distinctive style and employing a juryrigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed slapback. A single was pressed with Thats All Right on the Aside and Blue Moon of Kentucky on the reverse.\n\nEarly live performances and RCA Victor contract\nThe trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954. Later that month they appeared at the Overton Park Shell with Slim Whitman headlining. Here Elvis pioneered Rubber Legs his signature dance movement. A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed His widecut pants emphasized his movements causing young women in the audience to start screaming. Moore recalled During the instrumental parts he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking and the crowd would just go wild.Soon after Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly and disc jockeypromoter Bob Neal became the trios manager. From August through October they played frequently at the Eagles Nest club a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club then left again as the house western swing band resumed. Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore His movement was a natural thing but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. Hed do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick. Amid these live performances Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions. Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashvilles Grand Ole Opry on October 2; Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit the program.\n\nLouisiana Hayride radio commercial and first television performances\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on Louisiana Hayridethe Oprys chief and more adventurous rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. Soon after the show the Hayride engaged Presley for a years worth of Saturdaynight appearances. Trading in his old guitar for 8, he purchased a Martin instrument for 175 equivalent to 2,000 in 2023) and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston Texas and Texarkana Arkansas. Presley made his first television appearance on the KSLATV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after he failed an audition for Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By early 1955, Presleys regular Hayride appearances constant touring and wellreceived record releases had made him a regional starIn January Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star Eddy Arnold Parker was working with the new numberone country singer Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snows February tourBy August Sun had released ten sides credited to Elvis Presley Scotty and Bill the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs like Thats All Right were in what one Memphis journalist described as the RB idiom of negro field jazz others like Blue Moon of Kentucky were more in the country field but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both. This blend of styles made it difficult for Presleys music to find radio airplay. According to Neal many countrymusic disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the RB stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly. The blend came to be known as rockabilly. At the time Presley was billed as The King of Western Bop The Hillbilly Cat and The Memphis Flash.Presley renewed Neals management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser. The group maintained an extensive touring schedule. Neal recalled It was almost frightening the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them through some sort of jealousy would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when wed have to be sure to have a police guard because somebodyd always try to take a crack at him. The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In midOctober they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley whose Rock Around the Clock track had been a numberone hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm and advised him to sing fewer balladsAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November Presley was voted the years most promising male artist. After three major labels made offers of up to 25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presleys Sun contract for an unprecedented 40,000. Presley aged 20, was legally still a minor so his father signed the contract. Parker arranged with the owners of Hill  Range Publishing Jean and Julian Aberbach to create two entities Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo onethird of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions. By December RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer and before months end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.\n\n1956\u20131958: commercial breakout and controversy\nFirst national TV appearances and debut album\nOn January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville. Extending his bynow customary backup of Moore Black Fontana and Hayride pianist Floyd Cramerwho had been performing at live club dates with PresleyRCA Victor enlisted guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet. The session produced the moody Heartbreak Hotel released as a single on January 27. Parker brought Presley to national television booking him on CBSs Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program produced in New York City was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victors New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs including a cover of Carl Perkins rockabilly anthem Blue Suede Shoes. In February Presleys I Forgot to Remember to Forget a Sun recording released the previous August reached the top of the Billboard country chart. Neals contract was terminated and Parker became Presleys manager.\nRCA Victor released Presleys selftitled debut album on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs a bouncy pop tune and what would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll Blue Suede Shoesan improvement over Perkins in almost every way according to critic Robert Hilburnand three RB numbers that had been part of Presleys stage repertoire covers of Little Richard Ray Charles and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn these were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original RB versions of songs in the 50s Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar not piano the lead instrument in all three cases. It became the first rock and roll album to top the Billboard chart a position it held for ten weeks. While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the albums cover image of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\n\nMilton Berle Show and Hound Dog\nOn April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on NBCs The Milton Berle Show. His performance on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego California prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later Presley and his band were flying to Nashville Tennessee for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its original release Heartbreak Hotel became Presleys first numberone pop hit. In late April Presley began a twoweek residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative middleaged hotel guests like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party a Newsweek critic wrote. Amid his Vegas tenure Presley who had acting ambitions signed a sevenyear contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in midMay covering fifteen cities in as many days. He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of Hound Dog a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became his new closing number.\nAfter a show in La Crosse Wisconsin an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic dioceses newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... His actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presleys room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presleys autograph.\nPresleys second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBCs Hollywood studio amid another hectic tour. Milton Berle persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage. During the performance Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of Hound Dog and launched into a slow grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements. His gyrations created a storm of controversy. Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing if it can be called that consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginners aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway. Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music has reached its lowest depths in the grunt and groin antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos. Ed Sullivan whose variety show was the nations most popular declared Presley unfit for family viewing. To Presleys displeasure he soon found himself being referred to as Elvis the Pelvis which he called childish.\n\nSteve Allen Show and first Sullivan appearance\nThe Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBCs The Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen no fan of rock and roll introduced a new Elvis in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang Hound Dog for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... he set things up so that Presley would show his contrition. Allen later wrote that he found Presleys strange gangly countryboy charisma his hardtodefine cuteness and his charming eccentricity intriguing and worked him into the comedy fabric of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show Presley told a reporter I dont want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so Im going to go along but I wont be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance. Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him Presley responded No I havent.. I dont see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when its only music. ... how would rock n roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?The next day Presley recorded Hound Dog Any Way You Want Me and Dont Be Cruel. The Jordanaires sang harmony as they had on The Steve Allen Show they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced You know those people in New York are not gonna change me none. Im gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight. In August a judge in Jacksonville Florida ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance he largely kept still except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing Dont Be Cruel with Hound Dog ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeksa mark that would not be surpassed for thirtysix years. Recording sessions for Presleys second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller the writers of Hound Dog contributed Love Me.Allens show with Presley had for the first time beaten The Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented 50,000. The first on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewersa record 826 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident. According to legend Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows Sullivan had opined that Presley got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pantsso when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think its a Coke bottle. ... We just cant have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show! Sullivan publicly told TV Guide As for his gyrations the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots. In fact Presley was shown headtotoe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut with legconcealing closeups when he danced the studio audience reacted with screams. Presleys performance of his forthcoming single the ballad Love Me Tender prompted a recordshattering million advance orders. More than any other single event it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.\nAccompanying Presleys rise to fame a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the biggest pop craze since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra  and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture As Presley set the artistic pace other artists followed. ... Presley more than anyone else gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generationthe first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.\n\nCrazed crowds and film debut\nThe audience response at Presleys live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled Hed start out You aint nothin but a Hound Dog and theyd just go to pieces. Theyd always react the same way. Thered be a riot every time. At the two concerts he performed in September at the MississippiAlabama Fair and Dairy Show fifty National Guardsmen were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus. Elvis Presleys second RCA Victor album was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes Old Shep which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm showed the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique. Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presleys recordings from Thats All Right through Elvis rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that these records more than any others contain the seeds of what rock  roll was has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.Presley returned to The Ed Sullivan Show hosted this time by its namesake on October 28. After the performance crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy. His first motion picture Love Me Tender was released on November 21. Though he was not topbilled the films original titleThe Reno Brotherswas changed to capitalize on his latest numberone record Love Me Tender had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presleys popularity four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office. Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he madeOn December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results none officially released for twentyfive years became known as the Million Dollar Quartet recordings. The year ended with a frontpage story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in 22 million on top of his record sales and Billboards declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted. In his first full year at RCA Victor then the record industrys largest company Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the labels singles sales.\n\nLeiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice\nPresley made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance on January 6, 1957\u2014on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event as critic Greil Marcus describes Presley did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha if not a harem girl. From the makeup over his eyes the hair falling in his face the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik with all stops out. To close displaying his range and defying Sullivans wishes Presley sang a gentle black spiritual Peace in the Valley. At the end of the show Sullivan declared Presley a real decent fine boy. Two days later the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1-A and would probably be drafted sometime that yearEach of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one Too Much All Shook Up and Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear. Already an international star he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded Xray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad. Presley purchased his 18-room mansion Graceland on March 19, 1957. Before the purchase Elvis recorded Loving Youthe soundtrack to his second film which was released in July. It was his third straight numberone album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock Presleys next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley who came to regard them as his goodluck charm. He was fast said Leiber. Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes. The title track became another numberone hit as was the Jailhouse Rock EP.\nPresley undertook three brief tours during the year continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that youre liable to get killed. Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s decried rock and roll as brutal ugly degenerate vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung played and written for the most part by cretinous goons. ... This rancidsmelling aphrodisiac I deplore. Asked for a response Presley said I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor but I think he shouldnt have said it. ... This is a trend just the same as he faced when he started years ago.Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session they wrote a song on the spot at Presleys request Santa Claus Is Back in Town an innuendoladen blues. The holiday release stretched Presleys string of numberone albums to four and would become the bestselling Christmas album ever in the United States with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After the session Moore and Blackdrawing only modest weekly salaries sharing in none of Presleys massive financial successresigned though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks laterOn December 20, Presley received his draft notice though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film King Creole. A couple of weeks into the new year Dont another Leiber and Stoller tune became Presleys tenth numberone seller. Recording sessions for the King Creole soundtrack were held in Hollywood in midJanuary 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together. As Stoller later recalled Presleys manager and entourage sought to wall him off. A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.\n\n1958\u20131960: military service and mothers death\nOn March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus photographers accompanied him into the installation. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone elseBetween March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed basic and advanced training at Fort Hood Texas where he was temporarily assigned to Company A 2d Medium Tank Battalion 37th Armor. During the two weeks leave between his basic and advanced training in early June he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August Presleys mother was diagnosed with hepatitis and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same their relationship had remained extremely closeeven into his adulthood they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.\nOn October 1, 1958, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion 32d Armor 3d Armored Division at Ray Barracks West Germany where he served as an armor intelligence specialist. On November 27, he was promoted to private first class and on June 1, 1959, to specialist fourth class. While on maneuvers Presley was introduced to amphetamines and became practically evangelical about their benefits not only for energy but for strength and weight loss. Karate became a lifelong interest he studied with J\u00fcrgen Seydel and later included it in his live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to Presleys wish to be seen as an able ordinary soldier despite his fame and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity purchased television sets for the base and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit. Presley was promoted to sergeant on February 11, 1960While in Bad Nauheim Presley aged 24, met 14-yearold Priscilla Beaulieu. They would marry after a sevenandahalfyear courtship. In her autobiography Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In Special Services he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect he should serve as a regular soldier. Media reports echoed Presleys concerns about his career but RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge Presley had ten top40 hits including Wear My Ring Around Your Neck the bestselling Hard Headed Woman and One Night in 1958, and Now and Then Theres A Fool Such as I and the numberone A Big Hunk o Love in 1959. RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period most successfully Elvis Golden Records 1958) which hit number three on the LP chart.\n\n1960\u20131968: focus on films\nElvis Is Back\nPresley returned to the US. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later. The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans. On the night of March 20, he entered RCAs Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single Stuck on You which was rushed into release and swiftly became a numberone hit. Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of bestselling singles the ballads Its Now or Never and Are You Lonesome Tonight? along with the rest of Elvis Is Back! The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues menace driven by Presleys own supermiked acoustic guitar brilliant playing by Scotty Moore and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis singing wasnt sexy it was pornographic. The record conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things according to music historian John Robertson a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold a tempestuous dangerous lover a gutbucket blues singer a sophisticated nightclub entertainer a raucous rocker. Released only days after recording was complete it reached number two on the album chart.\nPresley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on The Frank Sinatra Timex Special. Also known as Welcome Home Elvis the show had been taped in late March the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheardof 125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewershipGI. Blues the soundtrack to Presleys first film since his return was a numberone album in October. His first LP of sacred material His Hand in Mine followed two months later it reached number 13 on the US. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis for a benefit for twentyfour local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records. A twelvehour Nashville session in midMarch yielded nearly all of Presleys next studio album Something for Everybody. According to John Robertson it exemplifies the Nashville sound the restrained cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next halfdecade the album is largely a pleasant unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis birthright. It would be his sixth numberone LP. Another benefit concert for a Pearl Harbor memorial was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presleys last public performance for seven years.\n\nLost in Hollywood\nParker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule focused on formulaic modestly budgeted musical comedies. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles but when two films in a more dramatic veinFlaming Star 1960) and Wild in the Country 1961)were less commercially successful he reverted to the formula. Among the twentyseven films he made during the 1960s there were a few further exceptions. His films were almost universally panned critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a pantheon of bad taste. Nonetheless they were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis who produced nine declared A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.Of Presleys films in the 1960s fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films rapid production and release schedulesPresley frequently starred in three a yearaffected his music. According to Jerry Leiber the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army three ballads one mediumtempo number one uptempo and one break blues boogie. As the decade wore on the quality of the soundtrack songs grew progressively worse. Julie Parrish who appeared in Paradise Hawaiian Style 1966) says that Presley disliked many of the songs. The Jordanaires Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone The material was so bad that he felt like he couldnt sing it. Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large according to biographer Jerry Hopkins the numbers seemed to be written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll.In the first half of the decade three of Presleys soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts and a few of his most popular songs came from his films such as Cant Help Falling in Love 1961) and Return to Sender 1962). However the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one topten hit Crying in the Chapel 1965) a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for nonfilm albums between the June 1962 release of Pot Luck and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback only one LP of new material by Presley was issued the gospel album How Great Thou Art 1967). It won him his first Grammy Award for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described Presley was arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time and really the last rock  roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs.Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The flow of formulaic films and assemblyline soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the Clambake soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new Presley album that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. By then of course the damage had been done as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a hasbeen to all but his most loyal fans.\n\n1968\u20131973: Comeback\nElvis the 68 Comeback Special\nPresleys only child Lisa Marie was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album Speedway would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas specialRecorded in late June in Burbank California the special simply called Elvis aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the 68 Comeback Special the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audiencePresleys first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and coproducer Steve Binder worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show NBCs highestrated that season captured fortytwo percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock n roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy. Marsh calls the performance one of emotional grandeur and historical resonance.By January 1969, the single If I Can Dream written for the special reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling the special reminded Presley of what he had not been able to do for years being able to choose the people being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison man. Binder said of Presleys reaction I played Elvis the 60-minute show and he told me in the screening room Steve its the greatest thing Ive ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I dont believe in.\n\nFrom Elvis in Memphis and the International\nBuoyed by the experience of the Comeback Special Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio which led to the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular nonsoundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh it is a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs soul songs and rockers with real conviction a stunning achievement. The album featured the hit single In the Ghetto issued in April which reached number three on the pop chartPresleys first nongospel top ten hit since Bossa Nova Baby in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions Suspicious Minds Dont Cry Daddy and Kentucky Rain.Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the Comeback Special offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker US28,000 equivalent to 233,000 in 2023) for a oneweek engagement. He responded Thats fine for me now how much can you get for Elvis? In May the brandnew International Hotel in Las Vegas boasting the largest showroom in the city booked Presley for fiftyseven shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore Fontana and the Jordanaires declined to participate afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new topnotch accompaniment led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations. Costume designer Bill Belew responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special created a new stage look for Presley inspired by his passion for karate. Nonetheless Presley was nervous his only previous Las Vegas engagement in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push and International Hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performancePresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore Cant Help Falling in Love which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life. At a press conference after the show when a journalist referred to him as The King Presley gestured toward Fats Domino who was taking in the scene. No Presley said thats the real king of rock and roll. The next day Parkers negotiations with the hotel resulted in a fiveyear contract for Presley to play each February and August at an annual salary of 1 million. Newsweek commented There are several unbelievable things about Elvis but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars. Rolling Stone called Presley supernatural his own resurrection. In November Presleys final nonconcert film Change of Habit opened. The double album From Memphis to VegasFrom Vegas to Memphis came out the same month the first LP consisted of live performances from the International the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. Suspicious Minds reached the top of the chartsPresleys first US. pop numberone in over seven years and his lastCassandra Peterson later televisions Elvira met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter He was so antidrug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana and he was just appalled. Presley also rarely drankseveral of his family members had been alcoholics a fate he intended to avoid.\n\nBack on tour and meeting Nixon\nPresley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the years twomonthlong engagements performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album On Stage. In late February Presley performed six attendancerecordbreaking shows at the Houston Astrodome. In April the single The Wonder of You was issueda number one hit in the UK it topped the US. adult contemporary chart as well. MetroGoldwynMayer MGM filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary Elvis Thats the Way It Is. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement he was threatened with murder unless US50,000 equivalent to 392,000 in 2023) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s often without his knowledge. The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 caliber pistol in his waistband but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.\nThats the Way It Is produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted The authority of Presleys singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the Americanroots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middleoftheroad sound. With country put on the back burner and soul and RB left in Memphis what was left was very classy very clean white popperfect for the Las Vegas crowd but a definite retrograde step for Elvis. After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a weeklong concert tour largely of the South his first since 1958. Another weeklong tour of the West Coast followed in NovemberOn December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with US. President Richard Nixon at the White House where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon who apparently found the encounter awkward expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore important that he retain his credibility. Presley told Nixon that the Beatles whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era exemplified what he saw as a trend of antiAmericanism. Presley and his friends previously had a fourhour gettogether with the Beatles at his home in Bel Air California in August 1965. Paul McCartney later said that he felt a bit betrayed. ... The great joke was that we were taking illegal drugs and look what happened to him a reference to Presleys early death linked to prescription drug abuse.\nThe US. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of its annual Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971. Not long after the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located Elvis Presley Boulevard. The same year Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award then known as the Bing Crosby Award. Three new nonfilm Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was Elvis Country a concept record that focused on genre standards. The biggest seller was Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas. According to Greil Marcus In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility one could find Elvis tomcatting his way through six blazing minutes of Merry Christmas Baby a raunchy old Charles Brown blues. ... If Presleys sin was his lifelessness it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.\n\nMarriage breakdown and Aloha from Hawaii\nMGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for Elvis on Tour which went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film for that years Golden Globe Awards. His gospel album He Touched Me released that month would earn him his second Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. A fourteendate tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive soldout shows at New Yorks Madison Square Garden. The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. Elvis As Recorded at Madison Square Garden became one of Presleys biggestselling albums. After the tour the single Burning Love was releasedPresleys last top ten hit on the US. pop chart. The most exciting single Elvis has made since All Shook Up wrote rock critic Robert Christgau.\nPresley and his wife had become increasingly distant barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resultedunbeknownst to himin her pregnancy and an abortion. He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him Presley forcefully made love to her declaring This is how a real man makes love to his woman. She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident and said it had been an overstatement. Five months later Presleys new girlfriend Linda Thompson a songwriter and onetime Memphis beauty queen moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials the failure of Presleys marriage was a blow from which he never recovered. At a rare press conference that June a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied Well the image is one thing and the human being another ... its very hard to live up to an image.In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the Kui Lee Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special Aloha from Hawaii which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, Aloha from Hawaii aired live via satellite to primetime audiences in Japan South Korea Thailand the Philippines Australia and New Zealand as well as to US. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week it smashed viewing records. The next night it was simulcast to twentyeight European countries and in April an extended version aired in the US receiving a fiftyseven percent share of the TV audience. Over time Parkers claim that it was seen by one billion or more people would be broadly accepted but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention. Presleys stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latterday persona became closely associated. As described by Bobbie Ann Mason At the end of the show when he spreads out his American Eagle cape with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back he becomes a god figure. The accompanying double album released in February went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the US. It was Presleys last US. numberone pop album during his lifetimeAt a midnight show that same month four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presleys defense and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans Presley raged Theres too much pain in me ... Stone must die. His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging Red West his friend and bodyguard felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided Aw hell lets just leave it for now. Maybe its a bit heavy.\n\n1973\u20131977: health deterioration and death\nMedical crises and last studio sessions\nPresleys divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973. By then his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a pethidine addiction. According to his primary care physician George C. Nichopoulos Presley felt that by getting drugs from a doctor he wasnt the common everyday junkie getting something off the street. Since his comeback he had staged more live shows with each passing year and 1973 saw 168 concerts his busiest schedule ever. Despite his failing health he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974Presleys condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist Tony Brown remembered his arrival at a University of Maryland concert He fell out of the limousine to his knees. People jumped to help and he pushed them away like Dont help me. He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybodys looking at each other like Is the tour gonna happen? Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up. ... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs enough for almost two albums Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974. Parker delivered RCA another concert record Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis. Recorded on March 20, it included a version of How Great Thou Art that won Presley his third and final Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. All three of his competitive Grammy wins  out of fourteen total nominations  were for gospel recordings. Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parkers attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful. In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two fullscale recording sessions. However the recording process had become a struggle for him.\n\nFinal months\nJournalist Tony Scherman wrote that by early 1977, Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek energetic former self. Grossly overweight his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts. According to Andy Greene of Rolling Stone Presleys final performances were mostly sad sloppy affairs where a bloated drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch. In Alexandria Louisiana he was on stage for less than an hour and was impossible to understand. On March 31, he canceled a performance in Baton Rouge unable to get out of his hotel bed four shows had to be canceled and rescheduledDespite the accelerating deterioration of his health Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment but it all seemed to go right past Presley whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books. Presleys cousin Billy Smith recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his past escapades but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.Way Down Presleys last single issued during his lifetime was released on June 6, 1977. That month CBS taped two concerts for a television special Elvis in Concert to be broadcast in October. In the first shot in Omaha on June 19, Presleys voice Guralnick writes is almost unrecognizable a small childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs casts about uncertainly for the melody in others and is virtually unable to articulate or project. Two days later in Rapid City South Dakota he looked healthier seemed to have lost a little weight and sounded better too though by the conclusion of the performance his face was framed in a helmet of blueblack hair from which sweat sheets down over pale swollen cheeks. Presleys final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena on June 26, 1977.\n\nDeath\nOn August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland Maine to begin another tour. That afternoon however his fianc\u00e9e Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion. Attempts to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead at Baptist Memorial Hospital at 3:30 pm. He was 42President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having permanently changed the face of American popular culture. Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presleys cousins Billy Mann accepted US18,000 equivalent to 91,000 in 2023) to secretly photograph the body the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirers biggestselling issue ever. Alden struck a 105,000 equivalent to 528,000 in 2023) deal with the Enquirer for her story but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. Presley left her nothing in his willPresleys funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates a car plowed into a group of fans killing two young women and critically injuring a third. About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery where Presley was buried next to his mother. Within a few weeks Way Down topped the country and UK singles chart. Following an attempt to steal Presleys body in late August the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Gracelands Meditation Garden on October 2.\n\nCause of death\nWhile an autopsy undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress Memphis medical examiner Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that drugs played no role in Presleys death. In fact drug use was heavily implicated in Presleys death writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible for instance that he had suffered anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist to which he was known to have had a mild allergy. Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death one reported fourteen drugs in Elvis system ten in significant quantity. In 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in Presleys accidental death. Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden viewed the situation as complicated Elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time. That together with his drug habit caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose it was a judgment call.The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia a condition that can be determined only in a living person and denied drugs played any part in Presleys death before the toxicology results were known. Allegations of a coverup were widespread. While a 1981 trial of Presleys main physician George C. Nichopoulos exonerated him of criminal liability the facts were startling In the first eight months of 1977 alone he had prescribed more than 10,000 doses of sedatives amphetamines and narcotics all in Elvis name. Nichopoulos license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of overprescription.\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis who had conducted thousands of autopsies as MiamiDade County coroner declared at its completion There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact everything points to a sudden violent heart attack. More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories if then. One of the examiners E. Eric Muirhead could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospitals team of pathologists he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... Early on a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed that Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes glaucoma and constipation. As they proceeded the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments. According to biographer Frank Coffey other plausible causes include the Valsalva maneuver essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppageplausible because Elvis suffered constipation a common reaction to drug use.\n\nLater developments\nBetween 1977 and 1981, six of Presleys posthumously released singles were topten country hits. Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually it became the secondmostvisited home in the United States after the White House. The residence was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006Presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 1986) the Country Music Hall of Fame 1998) the Gospel Music Hall of Fame 2001) the Rockabilly Hall of Fame 2007) and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame 2012). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Musics first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards Award of MeritA Junkie XL remix of Presleys A Little Less Conversation credited as Elvis Vs JXL was used in a Nike advertising campaign during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presleys numberone hits ELV1S which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the Billboard chart for the first time in almost three decadesIn 2003, a remix of Rubberneckin a 1969 recording topped the US. sales chart as did a 50thanniversary rerelease of Thats All Right the following year. The latter was an outright hit in Britain debuting at number three on the pop chart it also made the top ten in Canada. In 2005, another three reissued singles Jailhouse Rock One NightI Got Stung and Its Now or Never went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the rerelease of all eighteen of Presleys previous charttopping UK singles. The first All Shook Up came with a collectors box that made it ineligible to chart again each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top fiveIn 2005, Forbes magazine named Presley the topearning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year with a gross income of 45 million. He was placed second in 2006, returned to the top spot the next two years and ranked fourth in 2009. The following year he was ranked second with his highest annual income ever60 millionspurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of Cirque du Soleils Viva Elvis show in Las Vegas. In November 2010, Viva Elvis The Album was released setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks. As of mid2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products and he was again the secondhighestearning deceased celebrity. Six years later he ranked fourth with earnings of 35 million up 8 million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex Elvis Presleys Memphis and hotel The Guest House at GracelandIn 2018, RCALegacy released Elvis Presley  Where No One Stands Alone a new album focused on Presley love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker Lisa Marie Presley and Andy Childs the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie on the albums title trackIn 2022, Baz Luhrmanns film Elvis a biographical film about Presleys life was released. Presley is portrayed by Austin Butler and Parker by Tom Hanks. As of August 2022, the film had grossed 2618 million worldwide on a 85 million budget becoming the secondhighestgrossing music biopic of alltime behind Bohemian Rhapsody 2018) and the fifthhighestgrossing Australianproduced film. For his portrayal of Presley Butler won the Golden Globe and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor. In January 2023, his 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar sold at an auction for 260,000.\n\nArtistry\nInfluences\nPresleys earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family he would slide down off my lap run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them. In Memphis Presley frequently attended allnight gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that Guralnick suggests sowed the seeds of Presleys future stage act\n\nThe Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lanskys. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington known universally as the Big Chief maintained a steady bottom ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg then his right with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. He went about as far as you could go in gospel music said Jake Hess. The women would jump up just like they do for the pop shows. Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.\nAs a teenager Presleys musical interests were wideranging and he was deeply informed about both white and AfricanAmerican musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training he had a remarkable memory and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues and as Stoller put it He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music. At a press conference the following year he proudly declared I know practically every religious song thats ever been written.\n\nMusicianship\nPresley played guitar bass and piano he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons and played everything by ear. Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as Old Shep and First in Line from his 1956 album Elvis. He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as From Elvis in Memphis and Moody Blue and on Unchained Melody which was one of the last songs that he recorded. Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called Are You Lonesome Tonight. In the 68 Comeback Special Elvis took over on lead electric guitar the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public playing it on songs such as Baby What You Want Me to Do and One Night. The album Elvis is Back! features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as I Will Be Home Again and Like a Baby.\n\nMusical styles and genres\nPresley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly according to music historians. Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presleys first release on the Sun label writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction with the defining elements as the raw emotive and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling of the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar of country. In Thats All Right the Presley trios first record Scotty Moores guitar solo a combination of Merle Travisstyle country fingerpicking doublestop slides from acoustic boogie and bluesbased bentnote singlestring work is a microcosm of this fusion. While Katherine Charlton calls Presley rockabillys originator Carl Perkins another pioneer of rocknroll said that Sam Phillips Elvis and I didnt create rockabilly. According to Michael Campbell the first major rockabilly song was recorded by Bill Haley. In Moores view It had been there for quite a while really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.At RCA Victor Presleys rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher more intense manner. While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabillyrock and roll treatment he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career from the pop standard Blue Moon at Sun Records to the country ballad Hows the World Treating You? on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of Santa Claus Is Back in Town. In 1957, his first gospel record was released the foursong EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a millionseller it became the topselling gospel EP in recording history. Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first postArmy single the numberone hit Stuck on You is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its mild rock beat discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it upbeat pop. The number five Shes Not You 1962) integrates the Jordanaires so completely its practically doowop. The modern bluesRB sound captured with success on Elvis Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as Down in the Alley and HiHeel Sneakers. Presleys output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music often in the form of ballads such as Are You Lonesome Tonight? a numberone in 1960. Its Now or Never which also topped the chart that year was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song O sole mio and concluding with a fullvoiced operatic cadence. These were both dramatic numbers but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter veinWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the 68 Comeback Special the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter as he explained they had become hard to find. A significant exception was Burning Love his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s Presleys subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of Elvis in Memphis as well as Suspicious Minds cut at the same sessions reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid1970s many of his singles found a home on country radio the field where he first became a star.\n\nVocal style and range\nThe developmental arc of Presleys singing voice as described by critic Dave Marsh goes from high and thrilled in the early days to lower and perplexed in the final months. Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the vocal stutter on 1955's Baby Lets Play House. When on Dont Be Cruel Presley slides into a mmmmm that marks the transition between the first two verses he shows how masterful his relaxed style really is. Marsh describes the vocal performance on Cant Help Falling in Love as one of gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing with the line Shall I stay pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal.Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of How Great Thou Art an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions as Presley crafted for himself an adhoc arrangement in which he took every part of the fourpart vocal from the bass intro to the soaring heights of the songs operatic climax becoming a kind of oneman quartet. Guralnick finds Stand by Me from the same gospel sessions a beautifully articulated almost nakedly yearning performance but by contrast feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on Where No One Stands Alone resorting to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presleys he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime. Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something The warmth of his voice his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.Marsh praises his 1968 reading of US. Male bearing down on the hard guy lyrics not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records. The performance on In the Ghetto is according to Jorgensen devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms instead relying on the exceptional clarity and sensitivity of his voice. Guralnick describes the songs delivery as of almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity. On Suspicious Minds Guralnick hears essentially the same remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise but supplemented with an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism at suspected infidelity and anguish over impending loss.Music critic Henry Pleasants observes that Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion. He identifies Presley as a high baritone calculating his range as two octaves and a third from the baritone low G to the tenor high B with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a Dflat. Presleys best octave is in the middle Dflat to Dflat granting an extra full step up or down. In Pleasants view his voice was variable and unpredictable at the bottom often brilliant at the top with the capacity for fullvoiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy. Scholar Lindsay Waters who figures Presleys range as twoandaquarter octaves emphasizes that his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts grunts grumbles and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves but in decibels even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all. Presley was always able to duplicate the open hoarse ecstatic screaming shouting wailing reckless sound of the black rhythmandblues and gospel singers writes Pleasants and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.\n\nPublic image\nRelationship with the AfricanAmerican community\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired Thats All Right on Memphis WHBQ many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black. From the beginning of his national fame Presley expressed respect for AfricanAmerican performers and their music and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudupthe originator of Thats All Rightbang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt Id be a music man like nobody ever saw. The Memphis World an AfricanAmerican newspaper reported that Presley cracked Memphis segregation laws by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its colored night. Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom. In contrast many white adults did not like him and condemned him as depraved. Antinegro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase rock n roll Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans a rumor spread in mid1957 that he had announced The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes. A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet Louie Robinson pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock Presley granted Robinson an interview though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement I never said anything like that and people who know me know that I wouldnt have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock n roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Lets face it I cant sing like Fats Domino can. I know that. Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland reported of Presley He showed me every courtesy and I think hes one of the greatest. Though the rumored remark was discredited it was still being used against Presley decades laterThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to AfricanAmerican sources achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the 21st century the notion that Presley had stolen black music still found adherents. Notable among AfricanAmerican entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson who argued A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis. Moreover Presley acknowledged his debt to AfricanAmerican musicians throughout his career. Addressing his 68 Comeback Special audience he said Rock n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it adding instruments to it experimenting with it but it all boils down to that. Nine years earlier he had said Rock n roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues.\n\nSex symbol\nPresleys physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. He was once beautiful astonishingly beautiful according to critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder reported Im straight as an arrow and I got to tell you you stop whether youre male or female to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar it wouldnt make any difference if hed walked in the room youd know somebody special was in your presence. His performance style was equally responsible for Presleys eroticized image. Critic George Melly described him as the master of the sexual simile treating his guitar as both phallus and girl. In his Presley obituary Lester Bangs credited him with bringing overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America. Ed Sullivans declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presleys trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead barWhile Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sounds Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as aggressively bisexual in appeal. Brett Farmer places the orgasmic gyrations of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a spectacular eroticization if not homoeroticization of the male image. In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised objectifying version of white workingclass masculinity as aggressive sexual display.Reinforcing Presleys image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and AnnMargret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis one of Presleys early girlfriends later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene and most of these relationships were insubstantial.\n\nLegacy\nPresleys rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed originsrepeatedly affirmed by Presleyrock and rolls occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black cultureIn this regard Little Richard said of Presley He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldnt let black music through. He opened the door for black music. Al Green agreed He broke the ice for all of us.President Jimmy Carter remarked on Presleys legacy in 1977: His music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of American popular culture. Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication within a year of his first appearance on American network television he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.\nPresleys name image and voice are recognized around the world. He has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein said Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everythingmusic language clothes. John Lennon said that Nothing really affected me until Elvis. Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as like busting out of jail.\nFor much of his adult life Presley with his rise from poverty to riches and fame had seemed to epitomize the American Dream. In his final years and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death he became a symbol of excess and gluttony. Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing foods such as chickenfried steak and biscuits and gravy. In particular his love of fried peanut butter banana and sometimes bacon sandwiches now known as Elvis sandwiches came to symbolize this characteristicSince 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A longstanding conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death. Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace. An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected however faintly. On the anniversary of his death thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual. With Elvis it is not just his music that has survived death writes Ted Harrison. He himself has been raised like a medieval saint to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation.\nOn the 25th anniversary of Presleys death The New York Times asserted All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp he was its opposite a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rockandroll age his hardrocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.\nHe was ranked third on Rolling Stones list of greatest artists. Bono wrote in appreciation In Elvis you have the blueprint for rock  roll. The highness  the gospel highs. The mud  the Delta mud the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. Its all there with Elvis.\n Not only Presleys achievements but his failings as well are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy as in this description by Greil MarcusElvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life one whose presence no matter how banal or predictable brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day but also patriotic recitals pure country gospel and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great artist a great rocker a great purveyor of schlock a great heart throb a great bore a great symbol of potency a great ham a great nice person and yes a great American.\n\nAchievements\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide Presley is one of the bestselling music artists of all timePresley holds the records for most songs charting in Billboards top 40 115) and top 100 152) according to chart statistician Joel Whitburn 139 according to Presley historian Adam Victor.

Regarded as one of the most distinguished classical guitarists of the 20th century he played a significant role in improving the public perception of the classical guitar as a respectable instrument. Over the course of a career that spanned more than half a century Bream also helped revive interest in the lute.\n\nEarly years\nBream was born in Battersea London England to Henry and Violet Jessie n\u00e9e Wright Bream. At the age of two he moved with his family to Hampton in London where he was brought up in a musical environment. His father was a commercial artist and an amateur jazz guitarist who was unable to read music but had a finely attuned ear and could play a lot of popular music. His mother a homemaker of Scottish descent had a warm and loving personality but no interest in music. His parents divorced when he was 14. His grandmother owned a pub in Battersea and Bream spent much time there during his youth. The young Bream was impressed by the playing of Django Reinhardt he  later named his dog Django. Bream played the piano and cello as a child and Reinhardt inspired Bream to take up guitarBream began his lifelong association with the guitar by strumming along on his fathers jazz guitar at an early age to dance music on the radio. He became frustrated with his lack of knowledge of jazz harmony so read instruction books by Eddie Lang to teach himself. His father taught him the basics. The president of the Philharmonic Society of Guitarists Boris Perott gave Bream further lessons while his father became the society librarian giving young Bream access to a large collection of rare music.\nOn his 11th birthday Bream was given a small gutstrung Spanish guitar by his father. He became something of a child prodigy at 12 winning a junior exhibition award for his piano playing enabling him to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music. He made his debut guitar recital at Cheltenham on 17 February 1947, aged 13; in 1951, he debuted at Wigmore HallBreams father had reservations about his pursuing classical guitar. He claimed Bream would find it difficult to earn a living unless he played jazz or something similarly modern. His fathers remarks made Bream more persistent and committed to becoming a professional classical guitarist. Bream played the guitar first then the piano for his audition at the Royal College of Music even though the guitar was not taught at the institution at the time. When the college accepted Bream he was advised not to bring his guitar. Bream brought along his guitar regardless as he played for latenight performances. When the schools director discovered he was playing the guitar in one of the schools practice rooms Bream was asked again to leave his guitar at home. Breams response to the request was to leave the collegeLeaving the RCM in 1952, Bream was called up into the army for national service. He was originally drafted into the Pay Corps but managed to sign up for the Royal Artillery Band after six months. This required him to be stationed in Woolwich which allowed him to moonlight regularly in London with the guitar.\n\nCareer\nAfter three and half years in the army he took any musical jobs that came his way including background music for radio plays and films. Recording sessions and work for the BBC were important to Bream throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s. He played part of a recital at the Wigmore Hall on the lute in 1952. Bream pursued a busy career playing around the world. His first European tours took place in 1954 and 1955, followed beginning in 1958) by extensive touring in the Far East India Australia the Pacific Islands and many other parts of the world. His first North America tour was in 1959. 1960 saw the formation of the Julian Bream Consort a periodinstrument ensemble with Bream as lutenist. The consort led a great revival of interest in the music of the Elizabethan era. In 1963, Bream performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston with the US debut of his ConsortIn addition to master classes Bream was a tutor of the music summer school at Dartington.\n\nLater career\nIn 1984, Bream seriously injured his right arm in a car accidentIn 1991, BBC Radio and TV broadcast Breams BBC Prom performance of Malcolm Arnolds Guitar Concerto.

In the same period he toured the Far East visiting Hong Kong Taiwan Korea and Japan and performed the premiere of Leo Brouwers arrangement for guitar and orchestra of Alb\u00e9nizs Iberia at the Proms. In 1994 Bream made debuts in both Turkey and Israel to great acclaim and the following year played for the soundtrack to the Hollywood film Don Juan DeMarcoIn 1997, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of his debut he performed a recital at Cheltenham Town Hall.

He stated that he was influenced by the styles of Andr\u00e9s Segovia and Francisco T\u00e1rrega. Bream had some sessions with Segovia but did not actually study with him. Segovia provided a personal endorsement and scholarship request to assist Bream in taking further formal music studies.  Breams work showed that the guitar could be capably utilized in English French and German musicBreams playing can be characterised as virtuosic and highly expressive with an eye for details and with strong use of contrasting timbres. He did not consistently hold his righthand fingers at right angles to the strings but used a less rigid hand position for tonal varietyBream met Igor Stravinsky in Toronto Canada in 1965. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade the composer to write a composition for the lute and played a pavane by Dowland for him. The meeting between Bream and Stravinsky including Breams impromptu playing was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada in making a documentary about the composer.\n\nRecordings\nBream recorded extensively for RCA Victor and EMI Classics.

Originally a session player in many bands he has released many awardwinning recordings as a solo artist. In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia AM in 2011, he was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown. In 2019, he was listed by MusicRadar as the best acoustic guitarist in the world.\n\nLife and career\nOne of six children Emmanuel was born in Muswellbrook New South Wales Australia in 1955. He received his first guitar in 1959 at age four and was taught by his mother to accompany her playing lap steel guitar. In 1961, at the age of six he heard Chet Atkins playing on the radio. He vividly remembers that moment and said it greatly inspired him as a musicianBy the age of six he was a working professional musician. Recognizing the musical talents of Emmanuel and his older brother Phil their father created a family band sold their home and took his family on the road. With the family living in two station wagons much of Emmanuels childhood was spent touring Australia playing rhythm guitar and rarely going to school. After their father died in 1966, Australian Country Music star Buddy Williams approached the family and asked permission to take the Emmanuel brothers on the road with his touring show travelling around Australia. Tommy Emmanuel would go on to record a number of Buddy Williams albums in the early 1970s. Eventually the New South Wales Department of Education insisted that the Emmanuel children had to go to school regularlyThe Emmanuels eventually settled in Parkes. Tommy Emmanuel eventually moved to Sydney where he was noticed nationally when he won a string of talent contests in his teen years. By the late 1970s he was playing drums with his brother Phil in the group Goldrush as well as doing session work on numerous albums and jingles. He gained further prominence in the late 1970s as the lead guitarist in the Southern Star Band the backing group for vocalist Doug Parkinson. During 1986\u20131988 and 1995, he joined the lineup of the leading New ZealandAustralian 1970s rock group Dragon that had reformed in 1982, touring widely with them including a 1987 tour with Tina Turner he left the group to embark on a solo career.\nIn 1994, Australian music veteran John Farnham invited him to play the guitar next to Stuart Fraser from Noiseworks for the Concert for Rwanda. Emmanuel had previously been a member of Farnhams band during the early 1980s and featured on the album Uncovered and rejoined after the 1994 concert.\nIn July 1999, Chet Atkins commented that Emmanuel was a fearless fingerpicking guitar player and awarded Tommy and four others John Knowles Marcel Dadi Jerry Reed and Steve Wariner the Certified Guitar Player titleEmmanuel and his brother Phil performed live in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics in 2000. The event was televised worldwide with an estimated 285 billion viewersIn December 2007, he was diagnosed with heart problems and was forced to take a break from his hectic touring schedule due to exhaustion but returned to fulltime touring in early 2008. In 2009 he worked with fellow local artists Ray Burgess Marty Rhone John St Peeters and John Swanee Swan to release a single Legends of the Southern Land.In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia AM.At the 2011 TommyFest Tommy took the chance to talk to the audience about his strong Christian faith.\nThe Lord is my shepherd so I lack nothingits true he told the gathered crowds.\nIn 2012, Governor Steve Beshear awarded Emmanuel the state of Kentuckys honorific title of Kentucky ColonelDuring a July 2019 concert he mentioned recently receiving American citizenship.\n\nGuitar style\nEmmanuel had said that even at a young age he was fascinated by Chet Atkinss musical style sometimes referred to as Travis picking of playing bass lines chords melodies and harmonies simultaneously using the thumb and fingers of the right hand achieving a dynamic range of sound from the instrument. Although Emmanuels playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles including jazz blues bluegrass folk and rock this type of country fingerstyle playing is at the core of his technique. While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music his natural musical ability intrinsic sense of rhythm and charisma gained him fans from all over the world. As a solo performer he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstage. He usually completes studio recordings in one take.\nIn his solo shows he mainly plays guitars made by Maton an Australian guitar manufacturer. He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature models. He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his longstanding association with the brand. Emmanuel is known for the battered and worndown appearances of his guitars a result of his dynamic energetic playing and percussive techniques. One of his signature performances for example involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummers snaredrum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit.\nEmmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning EADGBE while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to DGDGBE G6 tuning and his TE1 to CFBEGC. He generally uses 012 gauge light strings on one EBG808 and 013 gauge medium strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1. This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed rather than spending time onstage retuning one guitarEmmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the fretboard to play some notes rather than using only his fingers to play  contrary to how classical guitarists play but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists. He frequently plays common threefinger chord shapes with just two fingers. He commonly uses a thumbpick a flat pick plectrum his fingers or a combination of these in his playing a style known as hybrid picking. Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitars tremolo system on acoustic guitar  by pressing the palm of his right hand against the sound board of the guitar near the neck joint while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the headstock. The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound.\n\nInfluences\nAs a young man in Australia Emmanuel wrote to his hero Chet Atkins in Nashville Tennessee. Eventually Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a longstanding invitation to drop by to visitIn 1997, Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo releasing the album The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World. It would be Atkinss last album with the exception of Solo Sessions which Atkins estate released posthumously. Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on The Nashville Networks Country Christmas in late 1997, and on that occasion Atkins stated about him He is one of the greatest guitar players Ive ever seen. Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which Arthur Guitar Boogie Smith recorded Guitar Boogie one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuels shows.\nIn July 1999, at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Convention Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award an honour Chet personally bestowed to only four guitarists. This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself a widely recognised leader in guitar music. The award states In Recognition of His Contributions to the Art of Fingerpicking. Tommy performed at the Chet Atkins Appreciation Society CAAS in July each year in NashvilleIn addition to being influenced by Chet Atkins Emmanuel has stated that he and his brother Phil Emmanuel were inspired by and modelled themselves on Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch of the Shadows.\n\nDiscography\nAwards\nAPRA Awards\nThe APRA Awards Australia are annual awards to recognise composing and songwriting skills sales and airplay performance by its members annually.\n\nARIA Awards\nThe Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards commonly known as ARIA Music Awards are held to recognise excellence and innovation and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 with the Eagles. Felder was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016.\nFelder was fired from the Eagles in 2001, after which he filed various lawsuits alleging wrongful termination breach of impliedinfact contract and breach of fiduciary duty. He published an autobiography detailing his tenure with Eagles Heaven and Hell My Life in the Eagles 1974\u20132001) in 2008.\n\nEarly life\nDon Felder was born in Gainesville Florida on September 21, 1947. He was raised in a Southern Baptist familyFelder was first attracted to music after watching Elvis Presley live on The Ed Sullivan Show. He acquired his first guitar when he was about ten years old which he has stated he exchanged with a friend at the fiveanddime for a handful of cherry bombs. A selftaught musician he was heavily influenced by rock and roll. At the age of 13 he started his first band the Continentals which also included Stephen Stills and Isaac Guillory.\nFelders family could not afford music lessons so he taught himself to play guitar by ear by listening to tape recordings that he played back at half speed.  He worked at a music school started by a Berklee graduate who taught music theory and some notation to Felder during his employment there.\n\nCareer\nEarly bands\nAround that time he met Bernie Leadon who later became one of the founding members of the Eagles. Leadon replaced Stephen Stills in the Continentals which eventually changed its name to the Maundy Quintet. Felder and Leadon both attended Gainesville High School. Felder gave guitar lessons at a local music shop for about 18 months at which time Felder also learned how to play slide guitar from Duane Allman. Although Felder claimed that he taught a young Tom Petty how to play the guitar Petty denied that he was ever taught the guitar by Felder clarifying that Felder instead taught him how to play pianoThe Maundy Quintet recorded and released a 45 rpm single on the Tampabased Paris Tower label in 1967, which received airplay in northcentral FloridaAfter the Maundy Quintet broke up Felder went to Manhattan New York City with a band called Flow which released a selftitled improvisational rock fusion album in 1970. The 1970 Flow album has the distinction of being among the first issued on the newly independent CTI Records label founded by noted jazz producer Creed Taylor. While in New York Felder improved his mastery of improvisation on the guitar and learned various styles. After Flow broke up Felder moved to Boston where he got a job in a recording studioIn 1973, Felder moved to Los Angeles where he was hired as guitar player for a tour by David Blue replacing David Lindley who was touring with Crosby  Nash. He helped Blue put together a tour during which they opened at a few Crosby and Nash shows in November 1973 and for Neil Young at the opening of the Roxy Theatre. Once again Felder replaced Lindley this time in Crosby  Nashs band when Lindley fell ill. He would also jam from time to time with the Eagles in their rehearsal spaceIn 1974, he featured on the Michael Dinner album The Great Pretender.\n\nEagles\nIn early January 1974, Felder was called by the Eagles to add slide guitar to their song Good Day in Hell and some guitar solos to Already Gone. Shortly afterwards he was invited to join the band. Concurrently the band began distancing themselves from their initial country rock style and moving more in the direction of fullfledged hard rock music. On the bands fourth album One of These Nights Felder sang lead vocal on the song Visions the only song of which he was lead vocalist which he cowrote with Don Henley and arranged the title tracks distinctive guitar solo and bass lineAfter founding member Bernie Leadon departed in 1975 following the tour to support the album Joe Walsh joined the band. Felder had previously jammed with Walsh while Leadon was still a member of the Eagles and together as dual guitar leads they would eventually become one of rock musics most memorable onstage partnerships. Felder also doubled on banjo mandolin and pedal steel guitar on future tours all of which were previously handled by Leadon.\nThe first album that the Eagles released after the lineup change was Hotel California which became a major international bestseller. Felder submitted 16 or 17 tracks that resulted in the songs Victim of Love and the albums title track Hotel California. For the title track after the arrangement and instrumentation had been refined several complete takes were recorded. The best parts were then spliced together in all 33 edits on the twoinch master to create the final version.  In contrast Victim of Love was recorded in a live session in studio apart from the lead vocal and the harmony on the choruses which were added later. Don Felder initially sang the lead vocals in the many early takes of Victim of Love but the band felt that his efforts were not up to the required standard and Henley then took over as lead vocalist.  After the release of Hotel California and the tour that followed the Eagles found themselves under tremendous pressure to repeat this success and tensions were made worse by alcohol cocaine and other drugs. Bassist Randy Meisner left the band after the tour due to exhaustion and he was replaced by former Poco bassist Timothy B. Schmit who had also replaced him in that band. Nevertheless the fighting did not end with the addition of the mildmannered Schmit but it rather intensified during the recording of The Long Run which took 18 months to complete and Felder and Glenn Frey were especially hostile to one another despite respecting each others musical abilitiesAccording to Henley Felder attempted to gain more control by coopting Walsh so frequently that it was the pair up against himself and Frey when the band was dividing into factions and even Henley and Frey began to have their differences thus causing the Eagles to disbandAt a concert in Long Beach California for Senator Alan Cranston on July 31, 1980, known as the Long Night at Wrong Beach things hit a breaking point in the band when the animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began after Felder said Youre welcome  I guess to Cranston and his wife thus offending Frey. He angrily confronted Felder and the pair began to threaten beatings throughout the show. Felder recalls Frey telling him during Best of My Love Im gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage. After the concert Felder smashed according to Frey Felders cheapest guitar. The Eagles disbanded shortly thereafter.\n\nPost1970s career\nFollowing the 1980 disbandment of the Eagles Felder focused more on his family but also embarked on a solo career concentrating on film composition and session work. He worked on the Bee Gees 1981 album Living Eyes as a session guitarist. Through his association with Bee Gees producer Albhy Galuten Felder made session appearances on albums by artists as diverse as Diana Ross Barbra Streisand and Andy Gibb. During this time he also contributed guitar work to Stevie Nicks first two solo albums Bella Donna and The Wild Heart.\nIn 1983, Felder released his first solo album entitled Airborne. The albums single Never Surrender cowritten with Kenny Loggins was a minor hit having also appeared on the soundtrack to the popular motion picture teen comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\nIn 1985, Henley offered Felder 5,000 a week US 14,165 in 2023 dollars to go on tour with him but Felder turned it down citing both dissatisfaction with the pay and a desire to not go on tourAmong his musical film credits in the 1980s are two songs on the soundtrack to the 1981 animated cult film Heavy Metal entitled Heavy Metal Takin a Ride with former bandmates Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit contributing backing vocals and  All of You  with Jefferson Starships Mickey Thomas as backing vocalist as well as the title track Wild Life from the 1985 motion picture adaptation of Neil Simons The Sluggers Wife.  He also penned the song Shes Got A Part of Me from the soundtrack to the 1985 romantic comedy Secret Admirer.\nFelders television credits include FTV a musical comedy show that parodied MTV and music videos which he hosted from 1985 to 1986, and Galaxy High the 1986 CBS cartoon series for which he scored and performed all of the music including the series catchy theme song.\n\nEagles Band reformation\nSparked by the success of the tribute album Common Thread The Songs of the Eagles the band including Felder regrouped 14 years later for a concert aired on MTV which resulted in a new album Hell Freezes Over in 1994. For the live MTV performance the bands signature song Hotel California was rearranged into an acoustic version and Felder kicked off the set by performing it with a new flamencostyle intro.\nFelder performed with all current and former band members the hits Take It Easy and Hotel California at the bands 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Manhattan New York City. He continued as a member of the Eagles until 2001.\n\nBand termination and lawsuit against the Eagles\nOn February 6, 2001, Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits alleging wrongful termination breach of impliedinfact contract and breach of fiduciary duty reportedly seeking 50 million in damages. Felder alleged that from the 1994 Hell Freezes Over tour onward Henley and Frey had insisted that they each receive a higher percentage of the bands profits whereas the money had previously been split in five equal portions. Felder also accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times more of the Selected Works 1972\u20131999 proceeds than would Felder. This box set released in November 2000, has sold approximately 267,000 copies and earned over 16 million. Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for breach of contract alleging that Felder had written and attempted to sell the rights to a tellall book.\nOn January 23, 2002, the Los Angeles County Court consolidated the two complaints and on May 8, 2007, the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Despite the settlement Felder has since filed subsequent lawsuits against the EaglesHeaven and Hell My Life in The Eagles 1974\u20132001) was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007. The American edition was published by John Wiley  Sons on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a publicity campaign.\n\nPostEagles\nNearly three decades after the release of Airborne his second solo album Road to Forever was released on October 9, 2012, with Fall from the Grace of Love as the lead single a song that featured the harmony vocals of Crosby Stills  Nash.\nWhen the Eagles did their History of the Eagles Tour 2013\u20132015, to coincide with their twopart documentary it was criticized by Felder for being incomplete. He did not participate in the associated tour. Since 2005, Felder has been touring with his own band the Don Felder Band. In 2014, they toured with rock bands Styx and Foreigner.  In 2017, Felder toured the US with Styx and REO Speedwagon.\nIn 2019, Felder announced that he would release his third studio album American Rock n Roll on April 5 on CD and vinyl. The album features musicians such as Sammy Hagar Slash who lives near Felder Richie Sambora Orianthi Peter Frampton Joe Satriani Mick Fleetwood Chad Smith Bob Weir David Paich Steve Porcaro Alex Lifeson and Jim Keltner among others. Felder will go on a worldwide tour to promote the new album. The title track references artists from Jimi Hendrix and Santana to The Doobie Brothers U2 Bruce Springsteen Red Hot Chili Peppers Van Halen Guns N Roses and more.\n\nPersonal life\nIn a 2008 interview with Howard Stern Felder affirmed that he remains friends with fellow former Eagles members Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.  When asked if he still had any contact with Frey or Henley Felder stated that the only replies he gets are from their respective attorneys.\nIn 2016, the day after Freys death Felder told the Associated Press that he felt an unbelievable sorrow when he learned about Freys death. I had always hoped somewhere along the line he and I would have dinner together talking about old times and letting it go with a handshake and a hug.\n\nArtistry\nEquipment\nFelder is known for his performances using Gibson Les Paul and Gibson EDS1275 doubleneck 6 and 12 string electric guitars. This prompted Gibson to name two reissues after him in 2010, the Don Felder Hotel California 1959 Les Paul and the Don Felder Hotel California EDS1275\". Felder himself is an avid guitar collector having amassed close to 300 models since childhood.\nFelder uses Fender Deluxe Reverb and Tweed Deluxe amplifiers modified by Dumble Amplifiers. When performing Hotel California the 12-string side of the 1275 plays through a Leslie speakerFelders pedalboard consists of a Voodoo Pedal Power a Fulltone OCD overdrive two Boss Digital Delay DD3's delays a Boss Chorus Ensemble chorus an MXR Talk box and a Peterson Stomp Classic tuner.\n\nOther activities\nAutobiography\nFelders autobiography Heaven and Hell My Life in the Eagles 1974\u20132001) was published in early 2008. The book allowed Felder to tell his life story describe his relationships with Glenn Frey and Don Henley and to relate his own version of his termination from the band in 2001. In an interview done on April 27, 2008 with Jim Farber of the New York Daily News Felder is quoted as saying that he wasnt out to hang peoples heads for the whole community to see that wasnt the point of the book.

Sunil according to Shankha Ghosh used to narrate the story using contemporary language which often allows readers to find aspects of themselves they may have not seen perhaps did not want to see. In doing so Sunil skillfully turned his personal confession into a shared experience for a wide readership. Sitanshu Yashaschandra observed that in his works the personal is never sacrificed in favor of the regional nor is Bengaliness ever given up to aspire for any larger status. He is a writer of international stature simply because he is a writer such a good writer.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Faridpur into a Bengali Hindu family in what is now Bangladesh.

Ganguly was not a Hindu or Muslim but a committed atheistIndian President Pranab Mukherjee condoled the death of Gangopadhyay saying\nGangopadhyay had enriched Bengali literature through his unique style.

A retired IPS officer lodged a case against Gangopadhyay in the Calcutta High Court. Against this controversy Gangpadhyay felt he had no freedom to express what he felt. Another Bengali writer Buddhadeb Guha found this a cheap gimmick and he told I dont support such cheap gimmicks. An author should set an example for the younger generations. If an author thinks its cool to say that he loves to booze and enjoys going to Sonagachhi then this only speaks poorly of him.\nIn September 2012 Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen accused Sunil Gangopadhyay of sexually harassing her and other women. She also alleged that Gangopadhyay was involved in banning her novel Dwikhandito and her banishment from West Bengal.\n\nList of major works\nPoetry\nHathat Nirar Janya\nBhorbelar Upohar\nSada Prishtha tomar sange\nSei Muhurte Nira\nKaydata Shikhe Nebe\nJodi Nirbason Dao\nPagol Kota\n\nNovels\nAutobiography\nArdhek Jibon\nChabir Deshe Kabitar Deshe\n\nTravelogue\nBijone Nijer Sathe\nAmader Choto Nadee\nTin Samudro Satash Nadee\n\nKakababu series\nTranslated books\nFirst Light ISBN 978-0-14-100430-3\nThose days ISBN 0140268529\nEastWest Penguin Books India\nThe Lovers and the other stories ISBN 81-7189-838-6\nPratidwandi ISBN 81-250-1902-2\nMurmur in the Woods ISBN 81-220-0568-3\nThe Youth ISBN 81-291-0125-4\nRanu O Bhanu Translated by Sheila Sengupta\nThe Lonely Monarch Translated by Swapna Dutta ISBN 978-93-5009-628-4\nBlood Translated by Debali MookerjeaLeonard\n\nAwards and honours\nAwards\n1972: Ananda Puraskar in general category\n1979: National poet honour was given by Akashbani Kolkata\n1983: Bankim Puraskar for the book Sei Somoy\n1984: Sahitya Akademi Award for the book Sei Somoy\n1989: Ananda Puraskar for the book PoorbaPashchim\n1989: Sahitya Setu puroskar\n1999: AnnadaSnowcem puroska for the story Nil Lohiter Golpo\n2003: Annadashankar puroskar\n2004: Saraswati Samman for Prothom Alo\n2011: The Hindu Literary Prize shortlist The Fakir\n2012: Sera Bangali Lifetime Achievement Award by Star Ananda\n\nHonors\n2002: Sheriff of Kolkata.\nHonorary DLitt. from the University of Burdwan\n\nSee also\nList of Indian writers\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nWorks by or about Sunil Gangopadhyay at Internet Archive\nSunil Gangopadhyay at IMDb\nSunil Gangopadhyay at Penguin India\nSunil Gangopadhyay at the MunzingerArchiv\nSunil Gangopadhyay at Poetry International\nSunil Gangopadhyay at The South Asian Literary Recordings Project Library of Congress New Delhi Office India", "Kirk Lee Hammett born November 18, 1962) is an American musician who has been the lead guitarist of heavy metal band Metallica since 1983.

Hammetts first guitar was in his own words a wholly unglamorous Montgomery Ward catalog special which was accompanied by a shoebox with a fourinch speaker for an amp. After purchasing a 1978 Fender Stratocaster copy Hammett attempted to customize his sound with various guitar parts before eventually buying a 1974 Gibson Flying V.\n\nCareer\nExodus 1979\u20131983)\nHammetts musical interests eventually drew him into the fledgling thrash metal genre. In 1979, he formed the band Exodus at the age of sixteen along with vocalist Paul Baloff guitarist Tim Agnello bassist Geoff Andrews and drummer Tom Hunting. Hammett named Exodus after the Leon Uris novel of the same name and played on the bands 1982 Demo and its successor Die By His Hand from 1983. Exodus was an influential band in the Bay Area thrash movement. During the Exodus phase Hammett took lessons from Joe Satriani who was based in Berkeley California at the time.\n\nMetallica 1983\u2013present\nIn 1983, Metallica traveled to the east coast to record its debut album Kill Em All. Due to lead guitarist Dave Mustaines substance abuse and violent tendencies he was fired shortly after their arrival and would eventually form the band Megadeth. Hammett received a phone call from Metallica on April 1, and flew out to New York for an audition on April 11, the same day Mustaine was let go. Vocalistguitarist James Hetfield said The first song we played was Seek and Destroy and Kirk pulled off this solo and it was like ... things are going to be alright!. Hammett was instantly asked to join the band.\nHammett has written a number of riffs for Metallica since Ride the Lightning the bands second album. One of his riffs was used on Enter Sandman  which went on to become one of Metallicas most popular songs. It was the first track and the first single on the bands selftitled album also known as The Black Album and was ranked 399th on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The bridge for Creeping Death was originally an Exodus riff that Hammett took with him to Metallica.\nIn 1986, during the bands European leg of their tour to support Master of Puppets the group had a dispute over sleeping arrangements on their tour bus. The outcome of the dispute was decided by a card draw which Cliff Burton won by picking the Ace of Spades. Once the draw was completed Burton looked at Hammett and said I want your bunk to which Hammett complied saying that he might be able to sleep better in the front of the bus anyway. In the early hours of the following morning Metallicas tour bus slid off the road and overturned in Sweden. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus which fell on top of Burton and subsequently killed him. Hammett has stated in an interview that he once thought that it easily could have been him who was killed instead since Burton was sleeping in what was considered to be Hammetts bunk. In Kirks own words You know to this day I just think it could have been me or it couldnt have been me but ... its never left me to this day.\nBetween the end of touring and promoting the Black Album and the start of touring in promotion of Load he studied at San Francisco State University focusing on film and Asian arts. Hammett went through a blues period around this time  which had some influence on Metallicas Load and Reload albums. He also began listening to a lot of jazz music. Hammett described this period of his life as great education because he was able to discover where all of his own rock influences had gotten their own guitar licks. However even though jazz music had a profound effect on his improvisation skills and solos Hammett felt that he was delving too deep into the genre. Since Death Magnetic Hammett has gone back to being primarily a metal guitarist but some of his influences of jazz and blues music still remainHammett wanted to have guitar solos on Metallicas 2003 album St. Anger but drummer Lars Ulrich and producer Bob Rock thought that the solos did not sound right in the songs. He later admitted himself We tried to put in solos but they sounded like an afterthought so we left them out. Recording for St. Anger was halted in 2001 so that Metallica frontman James Hetfield could enter rehab for alcohol abuse. Due to tensions within the band which were welldocumented in the Metallica documentary Some Kind of Monster at the time Hammett expressed interest in working on a solo album. According to Hammett if he ever worked on a solo album it wouldnt be superduty heavy metal and may include some classical guitarists. When he was asked about his experiences of recording St. Anger Hammett said\n\nHonestly I was ready to start working on a solo album. I had a bunch of music I was sitting on. I was going to ask Lars Metallicas drummer to play drums on it.\nOn April 4, 2009, Hammett along with Metallica bandmates Lars Ulrich James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo and former Metallica bandmates Jason Newsted and the deceased Cliff Burton were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2009, Hammett provided the foreword to British author Joel McIvers book To Live Is to Die The Life and Death of Metallicas Cliff Burton.\nIn April 2015, Hammett admitted to losing his phone  which contained 250 new ideas for Metallicas upcoming studio release. The incident happened about six months prior to the admission around November 2014). The phone was not backed up and Hammett can only remember eight out of the 250 ideas he had. On the subject Hammett said\n\nFor me music comes at all times of the day. When I get a riff sometimes its a complete riff and I can just play it and there it is sometimes its half a riff and I have to tweak it. Sometimes its just a rhythm or a note selection. Or sometimes its just something that I hum in my head. But it can come from anywhere and I put it on my phone and I make sure the phone is fucking backed up.\nIn 2016, Hammett provided the foreword to author Greg Pratos book German Metal Machine Scorpions in the 70sOn February 8, 2022, it was announced that Hammett would release an extended play entitled Portals.

Hammett has said that he used drugs because he thought they would be fun. During the Damaged Justice tour he had a cocaine addiction. Hammett eventually pulled out of the addiction because cocaine made him feel depressed but relapsed during the Load era.

The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.\nIn 2008, Jim Dunlop started working in partnership with Hammett to create a signature Wahwah pedal the KH95. Hammett said that the Ibanez Tube Screamer has been an essential part of his sound since he was a teenager but it was not versatile enough which started him searching for a better pedal.

He was also the lead vocalist for the band Capharnaum along with Triviums former producer Jason Suecof. In 2017, Heafy was voted sixth on the Ultimate Guitar list Top 25 Greatest Modern Frontmen.\n\nEarly life\nHeafy was born in Iwakuni Japan to a Japanese mother and an American father. His father formerly a member of the United States Marine Corps is halfIrish and halfGerman. Heafy has a younger sister Michelle who is now a YouTuber. Although Heafy was born in Japan he only lived there for one year and does not speak Japanese fluently however he uses some basic phrases when he performs in Japan. His family then moved to Orlando Florida where he currently resides. Heafy attended Lake Brantley High School. He completed his senior year while also touring in Europe and graduated in 2004. During those years Heafy used to live a straight edge lifestyleHeafy learned to play the tenor saxophone in years leading up to becoming more serious on guitar at the age of eleven. At that period he was mostly listening to pop punk bands and even auditioned for a local one called Freshly Squeezed by playing the Blink182 song Dammit. However following his audition he never got a followup call back. He also cites being introduced to heavy metal by his classmate David who gave him a copy of Metallicas selftitled albumHeafy does not know formal music theory and is almost completely selftaught. He does know how to read sheet music but can only apply it on the saxophone. However in 2015, he started taking formal training for the guitar.Selftaught for quite a bit of it did lessons on and off for maybe two or three years but I do not know anything formal music on guitar. I do on saxophone thoughbut that doesnt help me on guitar.Heafy still often uses the same first Gibson Les Paul he got from his father but only in studio settings. For live performances he uses his signature Epiphone Les Paul that is modeled off of his Gibson.\n\nCareer\nFollowing his guitar performance at the schools talent show Heafy was asked to try out for Trivium by the bands original singer Brad Lewter. Originally he was accepted as lead guitarist despite being only 12 years old other members were 15-16 at that time. Lewter however quit the band in less than a month due to creative differences over the bands future musical direction. The drummer Travis Smith persuaded Heafy to do vocals even though Heafy himself was unsure of his singing voice at that time. The band started looking for an external singer to fill in the position but had trouble finding a suitable candidate. Eventually Heafy agreed to become a fulltime lead singer for Trivium also keeping the position of lead guitarist for the band. He taught himself growling and screaming especially doing so during the bands early years. However he admitted using the techniques incorrectly most of his career which ultimately caused severe damage to his vocal chords in the years leading up to the bands performance at Rock on the Range in 2014, where he blew his voice on stage. That same year he started taking vocal lessons from coach Ron Anderson following advice from M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold. In 2016, Heafy returned to performing unclean vocals live with the same frequency as he did before his injury citing Andersons lessons as a source of help and improvement.  He claims that the new technique is actually easier than normal talking.\nWith the release of Triviums fourth album Shogun Heafy greatly expanded his vocal range from very melodic singing to hardcore screams. In 2011, Triviums fifth studio album In Waves was released with a greater emphasis on songs rather than skill with the album featuring the full range of Heafys vocal talents with some songs being entirely composed of screaming others with no screaming at all and many songs that fused the two as with previous records.\nIn Trivium Heafy sometimes shares lead guitar duties with Corey Beaulieu although he is responsible for recording the rhythm tracks on the albums.\nAfter Ember to Inferno Heafy jokingly played in the posthardcore genre releasing one song titled Head on Collision with a Rosebush Catching Fire under the name Tomorrow Is MondayOn December 4, 2020, Heafy released a collaborative 5-track EP with American YouTuber and musician Jared Dines.\n\nIbaraki\nOn January 21, 2022, Heafy unveiled the first single Tamashii no Houkai from his black metal influenced project Ibaraki.

He cofounded the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath and was the bands guitarist leader primary composer and sole continuous member for over five decades. He is considered one of the trailblazers and pioneers of heavy metal music and is responsible for inspiring numerous subgenres of metal most notably doom metal. Iommi was ranked number 13 on Rolling Stones 2023 list of greatest guitarists of all timeOn his last day of work in a sheet metal factory as a teenager Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand in an accident an event which crucially impacted his playing style. He briefly left Black Sabbath then known as Earth in 1968 to join Jethro Tull but did not record any material with the band and subsequently returned to Black Sabbath in 1969. In 2000, he released his first solo album Iommi followed by 2005's Fused which featured his former bandmate Glenn Hughes. After releasing Fused he formed Heaven  Hell which disbanded shortly after the death of Ronnie James Dio in 2010 they toured on Black Sabbath songs when Dio was in the band but changed the name for legal reasons.\nIn 2011, Iommi published his autobiography entitled Iron Man My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath.\n\nEarly life\nIommi was born at Heathfield Road Maternity Hospital in Birmingham the only child of Italian immigrants Sylvia Maria n\u00e9e Valenti from Palermo Sicily and Anthony Frank Iommi Sr. from Marche. Sylvias family were vineyard owners in Italy. The family was Catholic though they rarely attended Mass. Their family home in the Park Lane area of Aston also housed a shop which was a popular meeting place in the neighbourhood with the living room doubling as the shops stockroom. His mother ran the shop while his father was a carpenter by tradeBorn and raised in Handsworth Birmingham Iommi attended Birchfield Road School where future bandmate Ozzy Osbourne was also a pupil one year behind him. At age 8 or 9, while being chased by another boy Iommi fell and cut his upper lip. As a result he gained the nickname Scarface which made him selfconscious so he eventually grew his trademark moustache as a means of covering the scarAt about age 10, Iommi began working out and learned judo karate and later boxing as a means of protecting himself from the local gangs which congregated in his neighbourhood. He envisioned a future as a bouncer in a nightclub. Iommi initially wanted to play the drums but due to the excessive noise he chose the guitar instead as a teenager after being inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and the Shadows. He has always played guitar lefthanded. After completing school Iommi worked briefly as a plumber and later in a factory manufacturing rings. He stated that at one point he worked in a music store but quit after being falsely accused of stealing.\n\nFactory accident\nAt the age of 17, Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand his fretboard hand since he is lefthanded in an industrial accident on his last day of work in a sheet metal factory. Iommi described how he was told youll never play again. It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with my hand in this bag and I thought thats it  Im finished. But eventually I thought Im not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play.  After the injury Iommis factory foreman played him a recording of famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt which encouraged him to continue as a musician. As Iommi later wrote\n\nMy friend said Listen to this guy play and I went No way! Listening to someone play the guitar is the very last thing I want to do right now! But he kept insisting and he ended up playing the record for me. I told him I thought it was really good and then he said You know the guys only playing with two fingers on his fretboard hand because of an injury he sustained in a terrible fire. I was totally knocked back by this revelation and was so impressed by what I had just heard that I suddenly became inspired to start trying to play again.\nInspired by Reinhardts twofingered guitar playing Iommi decided to try playing guitar again though the injury made it quite painful to do so. Although it was an option Iommi never seriously considered switching hands and learning to play righthanded. In an interview with Guitar World magazine he was asked if he was ever tempted to switch to righthanded playing. Iommi responded\n\nIf I knew what I know now I probably would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years and it seemed like I had been playing a long time. I thought Id never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadnt been playing very long at all and I probably could have spent the same amount of time learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it but I just didnt have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.\nHe ultimately decided to continue playing lefthanded. To do so he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle  melted it down got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger  and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic which created two technical problems. First the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings causing a tendency to press down very hard on them.  Second he had difficulty bending strings leading him to seek lightgauge guitar strings to make it easier to do so. However Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time so he used banjo strings instead until around 1970\u201371 when Picato Strings began making lightgauge guitar strings. Furthermore he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than singlenote solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles helped with his technique because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning eg on Children of the Grave Lord of this World and Into the Void all on the album Master of Reality. Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a bigger heavier sound slackening the strings makes it easier to bend themIommi reflected in 2016 saying that his greatest regret is losing his fingertips.\n\nIt became a burden. Some people believe the accident invented heavy metal. It helped me invent a new kind of music. I play a new sound and a different style of playing and a different sort of music. Really it turned out to be a good thing off a bad thing. But I dont know whether it did. Its just something Ive had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style you cant feel the strings and there are certain chords I cant play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors You wont be playing guitar. But I believed I could do it and I did.\n\nCareer\nPreBlack Sabbath\nIommi had played in several bluesrock bands one of the earliest of which was the Rockin Chevrolets from 1964 to 1965. The band had regular bookings. Iommi later joined The Birds And Bees and when they were offered work in Germany Iommi decided to leave his factory job to take up the opportunity. From 1966 to 1967, Iommi played in a band named the Rest. It was in the Rest that Iommi first met futureBlack Sabbath drummer Bill Ward who played drums and sang in the bandFrom January until July 1968 Iommi was guitarist in Mythology with Ward joining a month later in midFebruary. In May 1968 police raided the groups practice flat and found cannabis resin which resulted in fines for the band members. Most significantly the incident made it quite difficult for the band to secure future bookings as most club owners avoided bands they viewed as drug users. Mythology subsequently split up after a gig in Silloth on 13 July 1968.\nIn August 1968 at the same time as the breakup of Mythology another Birmingham band called Rare Breed also broke up. Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne joined with Iommi and Ward after the duo responded to an advert in a local music shop proclaiming Ozzy Zig Requires Gig  has own PA. Requiring a bassist Osbourne mentioned his former Rare Breed bandmate Geezer Butler who was subsequently hired along with slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips and saxophonist Alan Aker Clarke. The sixpiece band were named the Polka Tulk Blues Band. After just two gigs the last of which was at the Banklands Youth Club in Workington Phillips and Clarke were dismissed from the band which soon after shortened its name to Polka Tulk.\n\nEarth and Jethro Tull\nIommi Butler Ward and Osbourne renamed the band Earth in September 1968. The same month Iommi briefly departed to join Jethro Tull. However after only two performances an appearance on The Rolling Stones Rock  Roll Circus in which the band mimed A Song for Jeffrey while Ian Anderson sang live and a live appearance at BBC Iommi was back with Earth in November 1968.\nConcerning his brief working relationship with Jethro Tull vocalist Ian Anderson Iommi said\n\nI learned quite a lot from him I must say. I learned that you have got to work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band Earth back together I made sure that everybody was up early in the morning and rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning which was believe me early for us then. I said to them This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it. They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour it made it more like we were saying Lets do it!\n\nBlack Sabbath\nIn August 1969, after being confused with another group named Earth who had minor success in England the group renamed themselves Black Sabbath. His factory accident affected the Black Sabbath sound Iommi had detuned his guitar by 1971's Master of Reality album lowering string tension and easing the pain to his fingertips. Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler did the same to match Iommi. Sabbath was among the first bands to detune and the technique became a mainstay of heavy metal music. Iommi combined blueslike guitar solos and dark minorkey riffing with a revolutionary highgain heavily distorted tone with his use of power chords a modified trebleboosting effectpedal and a Gibson SG.\n\nBy the late 1970s Black Sabbath were experiencing problematic substance use managerial problems and touring exhaustion. In addition the bands slow bluesdriven riffs were seen by some as outmoded against the rising generation of metal bands such as Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead. After the albums Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! were not universally critically well received Iommi and Butler decided that Sabbath needed a fresh start so in the summer of 1979, they replaced Osbourne with Ronnie James Dio the former vocalist for Rainbow. With Dio Black Sabbath produced Heaven and Hell an album that attempted to update Black Sabbaths sound for the 1980s and include the soaring vocals that characterised the NWOBHM New wave of British heavy metal scene. Halfway through the 1980 tour Bill Ward dropped out due to alcohol problems and displeasure with the direction that Dio was taking the band. He was replaced by Vinny Appice. With Iommi and Geezer Butler the only original members this lineup produced Mob Rules. Dio quit the following year to begin a solo career so Sabbath went through a revolving door lineup for the next decade with a succession of frontmen Ian Gillan Glenn Hughes Ray Gillen and Tony Martin. After Ian Gillan formerly of Deep Purple departed the band in 1984, Geezer Butler left as well. With Sabbath in effective hiatus Iommi recorded his first solo album entitled Seventh Star. The album featured Glenn Hughes also formerly of Deep Purple on vocals but due to label pressures it was billed as a release by Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi.\nIn 1992, Iommi appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert playing four songs with the remaining members of Queen and other guest artists. Geezer Butler also returned to Sabbath that year. In the following year Iommi teamed up with fellow Black Country band Diamond Head and cowrote the song Starcrossed Lovers in the Night for their 1993 Death and Progress album. At Osbournes farewell concert at Costa Mesa in 1992, Dio refused to perform and abruptly left the band. As a result Rob Halford was recruited to perform as the vocalist for two gigs Halford also sang at one of the dates on the 2004 Ozzfest tour when Osbourne couldnt perform due to bronchitis. Following Osbournes solo set the show concluded with the other members of the original Black Sabbath lineup joining for a 4-song reunion.\nBlack Sabbath went on to record two further albums with Tony Martin before the original lineup reunited as a touring band in 1997. While Bill Ward played at the two initial reunion shows at Birmingham NEC in December 1997, he was not present for the following two reunion tours his second absence due to a heart attack. Ward was replaced by Mike Bordin and then Vinny Appice.\nOn 11 November 2011, Black Sabbath announced that they would be reuniting with the original lineup and would be recording a new album. Bill Ward did not participate and was eventually replaced by Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk for drum sessions. The new album 13, was released in June 2013. They disbanded at the conclusion of The End Tour in early 2017.\nOn 9 September 2022, Iommi was featured as a guitarist for two tracks on Ozzy Osbournes album Patient Number 9. On 8 August 2022, Iommi reunited with Osbourne to play at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in their home city of Birmingham. They were joined by 2017 Black Sabbath touring musicians Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman for a medley of Iron Man and Paranoid. Iommi was also involved in the opening ceremony on 28 July 2022, where he played guitar on a song called Hear My Voice performed by British saxophonist and rapper Soweto Kinch.\n\nSolo career\nIn 2000, Iommi released his first proper solo album titled Iommi. The album featured several guest vocalists including Ian Astbury Skin Henry Rollins Serj Tankian Dave Grohl Billy Corgan Phil Anselmo Peter Steele and Osbourne. In late 2004 Iommis second solo album was released entitled The 1996 DEP Sessions. This album was originally recorded in 1996 but was never officially released. However a copy with a drum track by Dave Holland was available as a bootleg called Eighth Star. Glenn Hughes performed vocals on the album and he furthered his collaboration with Hughes with the release of his third solo album Fused. Released on 12 July 2005, John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff completed the trio on the album.\nIommi has signed with Mike Fleisss movie production company Next Films to score a series of horror films entitled Black SabbathSince 1989 Tony Iommi was involved in the Rock Aid Armenia project. In October 2009 Iommi and his colleague Ian Gillan were awarded the Orders of Honor  Armenias highest order which were delivered to them by the Prime Minister of Armenia for their help after the Spitak earthquake. They formed the supergroup WhoCares and recorded a single called Out of my Mind which was released 6 May 2011 for the benefit of the music school to be built in Gyumri Armenia. In January 2012, when Iommi was announced to have stage 3 lymphoma the Armenian Prime Minister sent a letter of support We know your spirit is strong as ever and we do believe the genius of your inspiration that guides you through the work on the new Black Sabbath album will transform into a boost of strength and energy that you need now when things look tough.Iommi made an appearance in 2020 on the track AstorolusThe Great Octopus by Candlemass which received a Grammy nomination.\nNovember 2021 saw a completely different side to Tony with the launch of a perfume in collaboration with Italian brand Xerjoff. As well as the scent Tony created a track and video his first instrumental single  Scent of Dark.\n2022 brought appearances at both the opening and closing of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Tony duetted at the opening with Indigo Marshall and was joined by Ozzy for the closing song.\nHe featured on two songs from the Ozzy Osbourne album Patient Number 9  No Escape from Now and Degradation Rules the latter winning the Best Metal Performance Grammy in February 2023.\n2023 has seen collaboration with Birminghams Royal Ballet on Black Sabbath  The Ballet which has proved to be a resounding success. His music from the first few Sabbath albums formed the bedrock that the complete music score was based on.  \nA Sky Arts documentary Greatest Guitar Riffs aired in November 2023, featured Tony and many close friends including Brian May discussing his work.\n\nHeaven  Hell\nIn October 2006 it was reported that Iommi would tour with Ronnie James Dio Geezer Butler and Bill Ward again but under the name Heaven  Hell. Later it was announced that Ward had decided not to participate and Vinny Appice was hired as his replacement. Rhino Records released The Dio Years under the Black Sabbath moniker album on 3 April 2007. The album showcased older tracks with Dio and also included three brand new songs recorded with Dio and Appice.\nThe band started an American tour in April 2007 with Megadeth and Down as opening acts. The tour finished in November in England with the prospect of an album to follow in 2008. During this period the bands show at the New York Radio City Music Hall was released as both a live DVD and CD with a vinyl release in the UK in 2008. During the summer of 2008 the band embarked on the Metal Masters Tour along with Judas Priest Mot\u00f6rhead and Testament. The bands first and only studio album The Devil You Know was released on 28 April 2009In November 2008 Iommi had a star revealed on the Birmingham Walk of Stars. Dio died of stomach cancer in May 2010, and on 14 June 2010, Iommi announced that Heaven  Hell would perform a oneoff tribute to Ronnie James Dio at the High Voltage Festival London on 24 July 2010. This was the bands last performance under the name.\n\nEurovision Song Contest\nIommi wrote the song Lonely Planet which was sung by Dorians for Armenia in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nCommonwealth Games\nPersonal life\nIommi purchased his first house in Stafford England in 1972. He also purchased an adjacent property for his parents. Iommi has been married four times\nIn late 1973, Iommi married Susan Snowdon to whom he had been introduced by Black Sabbaths thenmanager Patrick Meehan. The song Fluff one of Iommis instrumental compositions later released on the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath album was played as Snowdon walked down the aisle. Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham was Iommis best man for the ceremony. The marriage lasted for three years. Iommi said in a 1991 Guitar World interview that the troubled recording and mixing of Black Sabbaths 1976 album Technical Ecstasy contributed to the end of his marriage.\nIommi married American model Melinda Diaz in 1980. They had a daughter ToniMarie Iommi in 1983, who was the vocalist for the nowdefunct band LunarMile. Iommi divorced Melinda in the mid1980s. When ToniMarie was 12 years old Iommi won custody of her after she was placed in foster care. ToniMarie has described her early childhood with a mentally unbalanced mother as difficult but says that her father finally saved her. She has stated that with her father she was able to regain her trust in other people. Mikko Linde Lindstr\u00f6m guitarist with Finnish band HIM became engaged to ToniMarie in August 2010. In 2013, the couple were reported to have brokenup.\nIn 1986\u20131987, Iommi met an English woman named Valery and after a sixyear relationship they married. She had a son from a previous relationship named Jay. They divorced in the late 90s. Iommi confirmed in the same Guitar World interview referenced above a cointerview with Metallicas James Hetfield that he has a son. He told Hetfield regarding the bands socalled Black Album that my son gave me a copy of your latest album...\nIn 2005, Iommi married Maria Sj\u00f6holm formerly vocalist for Swedish alternative metal band Drain STH. They met around 1998, when Tony was working on music for Drain STH. After a year of talking on the phone in 1999, Maria relocated to England and moved into Tonys home. On 19 August 2005, without telling anyone Maria and Tony married at the Sunset Marquis hotel. On page 312 of his book Tony calls the lowkey wedding the Best thing I ever did!During the mid1980s Iommi was briefly engaged to rock musician Lita Ford formerly of The Runaways. Iommi coproduced her solo album The Bride Wore Black which to date remains unreleased. Ford herself has said that her involvement with him during that period was strictly personal and that he had no involvement in the halffinished album. She said in a 1989 Kerrang! interview that theres a certain amount of bad blood between Tony and I.On 19 November 2013, Iommi received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from Coventry University. The honorary degree came in recognition of his contribution to the world of popular music and recognised his role as one of the founding fathers of heavy metal music and his status as one of the industrys most influential figures the university said. Iommi is also a visiting professor of music at Coventry UniversityIommi holds dual British and Italian citizenship acquiring the latter due to his parents.\n\nHealth\nIn early 2012, Iommi was diagnosed with the early stages of lymphoma for which he underwent successful treatment. Black Sabbaths 2013 tour dates were arranged so that Iommi was free to return to the UK once every six weeks to have an antibody administered. On 3 January 2014, in a New Year message Iommi announced that he would be finishing his regular treatment some time that year. A few months later Black Sabbath announced that due to Iommis health issues they were undertaking their final tour. As of 11 August 2016 Tony Iommi announced that his cancer was in remissionAccording to a report in Rolling Stone magazine from 9 December 2016, Iommi revealed that he was due to have an operation to remove a lump from his throat. In an early 2017 interview with the UK radio show Planet Rock Iommi explained that the lump was not cancerous.\n\nReligion\nIommi said in 2016 that he believed in God and was a Catholic but that he had not attended church services since childhood. In January 2017, a choral work by Iommi entitled How Good It Is  with lyrics inspired by Psalm 133  received its debut performance at Birmingham CathedralCatherine Ogle the Dean of Birmingham said This is a most wonderful gift Tony offered to the cathedral. Despite this Iommi clarified to NBC News that How Good It Is wasnt anything to do with religion I dont follow any religious path.. religiously he statedIn his autobiography Tony writes that his parents were Catholics but werent regular churchgoers. He continues I hardly go to church either. I wouldnt know what to do there. I actually do believe in a God but I dont feel that I have to press the point.\n\nLegacy and influence\nTony Iommi is widely considered to be one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. In 2005, Metal Hammer magazine ranked him number 1 on the poll of the Riff Lords praising his highly distinctive style of fretsmanship thats economical yet crushingly effective. In 2007, Classic Rock magazine ranked him number 6 on their list of the 100 Wildest Guitar Heroes. In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 25 in their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Joel McIver ranked him the 6th greatest metal guitarist of all time. In 2012, readers of Guitar World ranked Iommi the seventhgreatest rock guitarist of all time. Editors of the same magazine ranked him the greatest heavy metal guitarist of all timeIommi has won a number of awards. These include Q Awards Gibson Les Paul Award 2015) Kerrang! Awards Icon 2018) as well as three Grammy Awards won as a member of Black SabbathIan Anderson of Jethro Tull has said Tony managed to turn his physical impairment around into something that makes him one of the guitar legends  if not for his dexterity of playing but at least for the fact that his contribution to rock music is a unique one. Gene Simmons of Kiss regards him as the man who came up with the riffs that launched an army of guitar players Ozzy Osbourne calls him the master of the metal riff  and Ronnie James Dio called him the ultimate riff master.Furthermore Iommi is recognised by many as the main creator of heavy metal music. Brian May of Queen considers him the true father of heavy metal Eddie Van Halen stated that without Tony heavy metal wouldnt exist. He is the creator of heavy! and James Hetfield of Metallica who was profoundly influenced by Iommi defines him The king of the heavy riff. Rob Halford vocalist for Judas Priest when filling in for Ozzy Osbourne during an August 2004 concert in Philadelphia introduced Iommi to the audience as The man who invented the heavy metal riff. Michael Amott of Carcass and Arch Enemy considers Iommi his guitar hero and the worlds greatest guitarist because he invented the heavy tone and evil riff. According to Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe Iommi is the reason heavy metal exists. HP Newquist of the National Guitar Museum stated that His guitar playing has defined the sound of heavy metal for more than four decades and he has influenced countless thousandsif not millionsof players.He has been credited as the forerunner of other styles Martin Popoff defines him the godfather of stoner rock Jeff Kitts and Brad Tolinski of Guitar World assert that grunge goth thrash industrial death doom.. whatever. None of it would exist without Tony Iommi. According to Hawaii Public Radio it is hard to imagine Nirvana Soundgarden Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains without Black Sabbath and without Tony Iommi. Judas Priest Iron Maiden Scorpions Metallica Slayer Pantera and essentially every metal band can be traced to the musical framework found in Iommi compositions.Many notable musicians count Iommi as a major influence on their own playing some of them include Jeff Hanneman Slayer Dimebag Darrell Pantera Slash Guns N Roses Velvet Revolver Scott Ian Anthrax Zakk Wylde Ozzy Osbourne Black Label Society Tom Morello Rage Against the Machine Billy Corgan The Smashing Pumpkins Kim Thayil Soundgarden and Nick Oliveri Kyuss Queens of the Stone Age. Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains was strongly influenced by Iommis dark bendings which he uses often. Andy LaRocque of King Diamond said that the clean guitar part of Sleepless Nights from the Conspiracy album is inspired by Iommis playing on Never Say Die.\n\nEquipment\nIommis deep and heavy sound was partly born out of necessityhis revolutionary signature sound being the result of the accident and the subsequent downtuning by three semitones. He said that his extreme volume was likewise necessary because we were fed up with people talking over us while we were playing.\n\nGuitars\nJaydee Custom SGsBuilt in Birmingham by luthier John Diggins sometime between 1975 and 1978, the guitar was first used for overdubs on the Heaven and Hell album and later became one of Iommis main guitars. The guitar is equipped with a 24 fret neck with custom cross inlays four control knobs three of which are functional a disconnected second output jack a hole for a master volume knob on the pick guard covered up with a black stopper and a highly distressed finish. He had two more built for him. One was made to the same specifications of his first Jaydee SG with a red finish. Another one was made and used during the Born Again era which can be seen on the music videos for Trashed and Zero the Hero. The differences are the finish headstock use of a stoptail bridge and use of rail humbuckers as opposed to the 18-pole humbuckers on his two other versions.\n\nGibson SG aka MonkeyA 1965 Gibson SG Special in red finish fitted with a Gibson P90 pickup in the bridge position and a customwound John Birch Simplux a P90 style single coil in the neck position. The guitar became Iommis main instrument after his white Stratocasters neck pickup failed during the recording of Black Sabbaths selftitled album. It is currently on permanent display at the New York City Hard Rock Caf\u00e9.\n\nGibson Custom Shop SGThe guitar was built by the Gibson Custom Shop in Nashville after Iommis specifications and finished in 1997. The guitar is one of two made as prototypes for the Gibson Custom Shop Limited Edition Iommi Special SG. The guitar features a neck with 24 frets and four control knobs of which only two are active much like his old Jaydee Custom guitar.\nOn 11 August 2010, Iommi announced on his website that this guitar was stolen from the RJD tribute show that Heaven  Hell performed at High Voltage on 24 July 2010. He is asking that anyone with information or leads let them know. He is offering a reward for its safe return.\nEpiphone P94 Iommi SGA stock Epiphone SG signature model in black finish fitted with P94 pickups which is a version of the Gibson P90 pickup designed to fit into existing humbucker housings.\n\nGibson SG StandardA regular lefthanded version of the SG fitted with two extra frets to give Iommi the full two octaves which he prefers.

His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing guitar skills and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Although his recording career spanned only seven months he is recognized as a master of the blues particularly the Delta blues style and one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as perhaps the first ever rock star.As a traveling performer who played mostly on street corners in juke joints and at Saturday night dances Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions one in San Antonio in 1936, and one in Dallas in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs with 13 surviving alternate takes recorded by Don Law. These songs recorded solo in improvised studios were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch 78 rpm singles from 1937\u20131938, with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the Mississippi Delta where he spent most of his life. Much of his story has been reconstructed by researchers.  Johnsons poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with him is that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads to achieve musical success.\nHis music had a small but influential following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938 John Hammond sought him out for a concert at Carnegie Hall From Spirituals to Swing only to discover that Johnson had died. Brunswick Records which owned the original recordings was bought by Columbia Records where Hammond was employed. Musicologist Alan Lomax went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson also not knowing of his death. Law who by then worked for Columbia Records assembled a collection of Johnsons recordings titled King of the Delta Blues Singers that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnsons work to a wider audience. The album would become influential especially on the nascent British blues movement Eric Clapton has called Johnson the most important blues singer that ever lived. Bob Dylan Keith Richards and Robert Plant have cited both Johnsons lyrics and musicianship as key influences on their own work. Many of Johnsons songs have been covered over the years becoming hits for other artists and his guitar licks and lyrics have been borrowed by many later musicians.\nRenewed interest in Johnsons work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him was reconstructed by researchers such as Gayle Dean Wardlow and Bruce Conforth especially in their 2019 awardwinning biography of Johnson Up Jumped the Devil The Real Life of Robert Johnson Chicago Review Press. Two films the 1991 documentary The Search for Robert Johnson by John Hammond Jr and a 1997 documentary Cant You Hear the Wind Howl The Life  Music of Robert Johnson which included reconstructed scenes with Keb Mo as Johnson were attempts to document his life and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts. Over the years the significance of Johnson and his music has been recognized by  the Rock and Roll Grammy and Blues Halls of Fame and the National Recording Preservation Board.\n\nLife and career\nEarly life\nRobert Leroy Johnson was born in Hazlehurst Mississippi possibly on May 8, 1911, to Julia Major Dodds born October 1874) and Noah Johnson born December 1884). Julia was married to Charles Dodds born February 1865) a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert but in less than two years she brought the boy to Memphis to live with her husband who had changed his name to Charles Spencer.  Robert spent the next 8\u20139 years growing up in Memphis and attending the Carnes Avenue Colored School where he received lessons in arithmetic reading language music geography and physical exercise.  It was in Memphis that he acquired his love for and knowledge of the blues and popular music.  His education and urban context placed him apart from most of his contemporary blues musicians.\nRobert rejoined his mother around 1919\u20131920 after she married an illiterate sharecropper named Will Dusty Willis. They originally settled on a plantation in Lucas Township in Crittenden County Arkansas but soon moved across the Mississippi River to Commerce in the Mississippi Delta near Tunica and Robinsonville. They lived on the Abbay  Leatherman Plantation. Julias new husband was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as Little Robert Dusty but he was registered at Tunicas Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census he is listed as Robert Spencer living in Lucas Arkansas with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927.  The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a man of his background. A school friend Willie Coffee who was interviewed and filmed in later life recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp. Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods which suggests that he may have been living and studying in MemphisOnce Julia informed Robert about his biological father Robert adopted the surname Johnson using it on the certificate of his marriage to fourteenyearold Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after. Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher Robert Mack McCormick that this was a divine punishment for Roberts decision to sing secular songs known as selling your soul to the Devil. McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a fulltime blues musicianAround this time the blues musician Son House moved to Robinsonville where his musical partner Willie Brown lived. Late in life House remembered Johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville close to his birthplace possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of House and learned other styles from Isaiah Ike Zimmerman. Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.\nWhen Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique. House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnsons technique to this pact and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmationWhile living in Martinsville Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple settled for a while in Clarksdale Mississippi in the Delta but Johnson soon left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician and Caletta died in early 1933.\n\nItinerant musician\nFrom 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of Memphis and Helena and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas. On occasion he traveled much further. The blues musician Johnny Shines accompanied him to Chicago Texas New York Canada Kentucky and Indiana. Henry Townsend shared a musical engagement with him in St. Louis. In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends. He did not marry again but formed some longterm relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with whatever woman he was able to seduce at his performance. In each location Johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places employing at least eight distinct surnamesBiographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts Shines who traveled extensively with him Robert Lockwood Jr who knew him as his mothers partner David Honeyboy Edwards whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson. From a mass of partial conflicting and inconsistent eyewitness accounts biographers have attempted to summarize Johnsons character. He was well mannered he was soft spoken he was indecipherable. As for his character everyone seems to agree that while he was pleasant and outgoing in public in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way. Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly averageexcept of course for his musical talent his weakness for whiskey and women and his commitment to the road.When Johnson arrived in a new town he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions but instead pleased audiences by performing more wellknown pop standards of the day  and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience in every town in which he stopped he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.\nShines was 20 when he met Johnson in 1936. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself Johnson was actually four years older. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charterss Robert Johnson\n\nRobert was a very friendly person even though he was sulky at times you know. And I hung around Robert for quite a while. One evening he disappeared. He was kind of a peculiar fellow. Robertd be standing up playing some place playing like nobodys business. At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure. And moneyd be coming from all directions. But Robertd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing. And you wouldnt see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks. ... So Robert and I we began journeying off. I was just matter of fact tagging along.\nDuring this time Johnson established what would be a relatively longterm relationship with Estella Coleman a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood Jr.  Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them and in most cases he was accepted until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.\nIn 1941, Alan Lomax learned from Muddy Waters that Johnson had performed in the area around Clarksdale Mississippi. By 1959, the historian Samuel Charters could add only that Will Shade of the Memphis Jug Band remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in West Memphis Arkansas. In the last year of his life Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis Chicago Detroit and New York City. In 1938, Columbia Records producer John H. Hammond who owned some of Johnsons records directed record producer Don Law to seek out Johnson to book him for the first From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. On learning of Johnsons death Hammond replaced him with Big Bill Broonzy but he played two of Johnsons records from the stage.\n\nRecording sessions\nIn Jackson Mississippi around 1936, Johnson sought out H. C. Speir who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle who as a salesman for the ARC group of labels introduced Johnson to Don Law to record his first sessions in San Antonio Texas. The recording session was held on November 23\u201325, 1936, in room 414 of the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio. In the ensuing threeday session Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. Among the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were I Believe Ill Dust My Broom Sweet Home Chicago and Cross Road Blues which later became blues standards. The first to be released was Terraplane Blues backed with Last Fair Deal Gone Down which sold as many as 10,000 copiesJohnson traveled to Dallas Texas for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the Vitagraph Warner Bros Building on June 19\u201320, 1937. Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in Dallas and eleven records from this session were released within the following year. Most of Johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his era. In contrast to most Delta players Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side.\n\nDeath\nJohnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near Greenwood Mississippi of unknown causes. Johnsons death was not reported publicly. Almost 30 years later Gayle Dean Wardlow a Mississippibased musicologist researching Johnsons life found Johnsons death certificate which listed only the date and location with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy had been done. Instead a pro forma examination was done to file the death certificate and no immediate cause of death was determined. It is likely he had congenital syphilis and it was suspected later by medical professionals that this may have been a contributing factor in his death. However 30 years of local oral tradition had like the rest of his life story built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical recordSeveral differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about 15 miles 24 km from Greenwood. According to one theory Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician Sonny Boy Williamson Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle Williamson knocked it out of his hand admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied Dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand. Soon after he was offered another poisoned bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The musicologist Robert Mack McCormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview but he declined to reveal the mans nameWhile strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves in his book Crossroads The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal and that death from the poison would occur within hours not daysIn their 2019 book Up Jumped the Devil Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow suggest that the poison was naphthalene from dissolved mothballs.  This was a common way of poisoning people in the rural South but was rarely fatal. However Johnson had been diagnosed with an ulcer and with esophageal varices and the poison was sufficient to cause them to hemorrhage. He died after two days of severe abdominal pain vomiting and bleeding from the mouthThe Leflore County registrar Cornelia Jordan years later and after conducting an investigation into Johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics R. N. Whitfield wrote a clarifying note on the back of Johnsons death certificate\n\nI talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the negro man seemingly about 26 years old came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.\nIn 2006, a medical practitioner David Connell suggested on the basis of photographs showing Johnsons unnaturally long fingers and one bad eye that Johnson may have had Marfan syndrome which could have both affected his guitar playing and contributed to his death due to aortic dissection.\n\nGravesite\nThe exact location of Johnsons grave is officially unknown three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside Greenwood.\n\nResearch in the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests Johnson was buried in the graveyard of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church near Morgan City Mississippi not far from Greenwood in an unmarked grave. A oneton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk listing all of Johnsons song titles with a central inscription by Peter Guralnick was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the Mount Zion Memorial Fund.\nIn 1990, a small marker with the epitaph Resting in the Blues was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel near Quito Mississippi by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones after they saw a photograph in Living Blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnsons exgirlfriends to be Johnsons burial site.\nMore recent research by Stephen LaVere including statements from Rosie Eskridge the wife of the supposed gravedigger in 2000) indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church north of Greenwood along Money Road. Through LaVere Sony Music placed a marker at this site which bears LaVeres name as well as Johnsons.   Researchers Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow also concluded this was Johnsons resting place in their 2019 biographyJohn Hammond Jr in the documentary The Search for Robert Johnson 1991) suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave or potters field very near where he died.\n\nDevil legend\nAccording to legend as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. One of the legends often told says that Johnson was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near Dockery Plantation at midnight. There are claims for other sites as the location of the crossroads There he was met by a large black man the Devil who took the guitar and tuned it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson giving him mastery of the instrument. This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of Faust. In exchange for his soul Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.\nThis story was originally associated with Delta blues musician Tommy Johnson to whom Robert Johnson was unrelated. Tommy Johnson who grew up near the Dockery Plantation and learned the blues from Charlie Patton and Willie Brown first claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.\n\nVarious accounts\nThis legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by Gayle Dean Wardlow Edward Komara and Elijah Wald who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death. Son House once told the story to Pete Welding as an explanation of Johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between Houses observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.\nFurther details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by Greil Marcus and Robert Palmer. Most significantly the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence including a full chapter on the subject in the biography Crossroads by Tom Graves suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician Tommy Johnson. This story was collected from his musical associate Ishman Bracey and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s. One version of Ledell Johnsons account was published in David Evanss 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside Houses story in the widely read Searching for Robert Johnson by Peter Guralnick.\nIn another version Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zimmerman of Hazlehurst Mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zimmerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson.  Recent research by the blues scholar Bruce Conforth in Living Blues magazine makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night because it was quiet and no one would disturb them but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby Beauregard and he did not practice in one graveyard but in several in the area. Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.\nWhile Dockery Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads there are also tourist attractions claiming to be The Crossroads in both Clarksdale and Memphis. Residents of Rosedale Mississippi claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town while the 1986 movie Crossroads was filmed in Beulah Mississippi. The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads because Robert Johnson was a rambling guy.\n\nInterpretations\nSome scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the trickster god of African origin Legba himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when AfricanAmericans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a deal not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves with the socalled devil at the crossroads.\nThe Blues and the Blues singer has really special powers over women especially. It is said that the Blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted. And so when Robert Johnson came back having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics people said he must have sold his soul to the devil. And that fits in with this old African association with the crossroads where you find wisdom you go down to the crossroads to learn and in his case to learn in a Faustian pact with the devil. You sell your soul to become the greatest musician in history.\nThis view that the devil in Johnsons songs is derived from an African deity was disputed by the blues scholar David Evans in an essay published in 1999, Demythologizing the Blues\n\nThere are ... several serious problems with this crossroads myth. The devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore and nowhere do blues singers ever mention Legba or any other African deity in their songs or other lore. The actual African music connected with cults of Legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral callandresponse singing.\nThe musicologist Alan Lomax dismissed the myth stating In fact every blues fiddler banjo picker harp blower piano strummer and guitar framer was in the opinion of both himself and his peers a child of the Devil a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme.Both Lomaxs and Evanss accounts themselves have been disputed and dismissed by Black scholars and authors including Amiri Baraka and Cornel West. West defines Blues as a creation of a people who are willing to look unflinchingly at catastrophic conditions as children of God responding to those conditions. Barakas words are more directly critical of white writers who study AfricanAmerican Blues artform and culture from a Western viewpoint stating that They have to do that to make themselves superior in some kind of way that everything has come from Europe which is not true. Baraka cites that rather than being formed out of any Western context Blues derives from an African context of its own. The callandresponse singing Lomax argues is different from Blues has been widely cited as being a central aspect of Blues music.\n\nMusical style\nJohnson is considered a master of the blues particularly of the Delta blues style. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones said in 1990, You want to know how good the blues can get? Well this is it. But according to Elijah Wald in his book Escaping the Delta Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. His first recorded song Kind Hearted Woman Blues in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time more resembled the style of Chicago or St. Louis with a fullfledged abundantly varied musical arrangement. The song was part of a cycle of spinoffs and response songs that began with Leroy Carrs Mean Mistreater Mama 1934). According to Wald it was the most musically complex in the cycle and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses.  Unusual for a Delta player of the time a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. Theyre Red Hot from his first recording session shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the Harlem Hamfats but as Wald remarked no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a downhome Ink Spots ... He could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them.\n\nVoice\nAn important aspect of Johnsons singing was his use of microtonality. These subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. Eric Clapton described Johnsons music as the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice. In two takes of Me and the Devil Blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing. The songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked. Generations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism wrote Wald have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performerJohnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song a technique later perfected by BB. King and his personified guitar named Lucille In Africa and in AfroAmerican tradition there is the tradition of the talking instrument beginning with the drums ... the onestrand and then the sixstrings with bottleneckstyle performance it becomes a competing voice ... or a complementary voice ... in the performance.\n\nInstrument\nJohnson mastered the guitar being considered today one of the alltime greats on the instrument. His approach was complex and musically advanced. When Keith Richards was first introduced to Johnsons music by his bandmate Brian Jones he asked Who is the other guy playing with him? not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. I was hearing two guitars and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself said Richards who later stated that Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself. As for his guitar technique its politely reedy but ambitiously eclecticmoving effortlessly from henpicking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chuckachucka rhythm figures.\n\nLyrics\nIn The Story with Dick Gordon Bill Ferris of American Public Media said Robert Johnson I think of in the same way I think of the British Romantic poets Keats and Shelley who burned out early who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry ... The Blues if anything are deeply sexual. You know my car doesnt run Im gonna check my oil ... if you dont like my apples dont shake my tree. Every verse has sexuality associated with it.\n\nInfluences\nJohnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on Ramblin on My Mind is pure Delta and Johnsons vocal there has a touch of ... Son House rawness but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta bluesit is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville. Johnson did record versions of Preaching the Blues and Walking Blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style Houses chronology has been questioned by Guralnick. As with the first take of Come On in My Kitchen the influence of Skip James is evident in Jamess Devil Got My Woman but the lyrics rise to the level of firstrate poetry and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded outputThe sad romantic Love in Vain successfully blends several of Johnsons disparate influences. The form including the wordless last verse follows Leroy Carrs last hit When the Sun Goes Down the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song Blind Lemon Jefferson recorded in 1926.  Johnsons last recording Milkcows Calf Blues is his most direct tribute to Kokomo Arnold who wrote Milkcow Blues and influenced Johnsons vocal style.From Four Until Late shows Johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of Lonnie Johnson and his guitar style is more that of a ragtimeinfluenced player like Blind Blake. Lonnie Johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style Malted Milk and Drunken Hearted Man. Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnsons Life Saver Blues.  The two takes of Me and the Devil Blues show the influence of Peetie Wheatstraw calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heartcry of a demondriven folk artist.\n\nLegacy\nEarly recognition and reviews\nFamed producer John Hammond was an early advocate of Johnsons music.  Using the penname Henry Johnson he wrote his first article on Robert Johnson for the New Masses magazine in March 1937, around the time of the release of Johnsons first record.  In it he described Johnson as the greatest Negro blues singer who has cropped up in recent years ... Johnson makes Leadbelly sound like an accomplished poseur.  The following year Hammond hoped to get Johnson to perform at a December 1938 From Spirituals to Swing concert in New York City as he was unaware that Johnson had died in August. Instead Hammond played two of his recordings Walkin Blues and Preachin Blues Up Jumped the Devil for the audience and praised Johnson lavishly from the stage. Music historian Ted Gioia noted Here if only through the medium of recordings Hammond used his considerable influence at this historic event to advocate a position of preeminence for the late Delta bluesman. Music educator James Perone also saw that the event underscored Robert Johnsons specific importance as a recording artist.  In 1939, Columbia issued a final single pairing Preachin Blues with Love in Vain.In 1940, nine of Johnsons songs were included on a List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records prepared by musicologist Alan Lomax for a US. government conference. Lomaxs notations for the entries range from elaborate sex symbolism Terraplane Blues very nice love song Im a Steady Rollin Man to traces of voodoo Stones in My Passway Hellhound on My Trail Cross Road Blues.  In 1942, commentary on Johnsons Terraplane Blues and Last Fair Deal Gone Down appeared in The Jazz Record Book edited by Charles Edward Smith. The authors described Johnsons vocals as imaginative and thrilling and his guitar playing as exciting as almost anything in the folk blues field.   Music writer Rudi Blesh included a review of Johnsons Hellhound on My Trail in his 1946 book Shining Trumpets a History of Jazz. He noted the personal and creative way Johnson approached the songs harmony. Jim Wilson then a writer for the Detroit Free Press also mentioned his unconventional use of harmony.  In a 1949 review he compared elements of John Lee Hookers recent debut Boogie Chillen His Hookers dynamic rhythms and subtle nuances on the guitar and his startling disregard for familiar scale and harmony patterns show similarity to the work of Robert Johnson who made many fine records in this vein.Samuel Charters drew further attention to Johnson in a fivepage section in his 1959 book The Country Blues.  He focused on the two Johnson recordings that referred to images of the devil or hell  Hellhound on My Trail and Me and the Devil Blues  to suggest that Johnson was a deeply troubled individual.  Charters also included Johnsons Preachin Blues on the album published alongside his book. Columbia Records first album of Johnsons recordings King of the Delta Blues Singers was issued two years later.\n\nMusicianship\nJohnson is mentioned as one of the Delta artists who was a strong influence on blues singers in postwar styles. However it is Johnsons guitar technique that is often identified as his greatest contribution. Blues historian Edward Komara wrote\n\nThe execution of a driving bass beat on a plectrum instrument like the guitar instead of the piano is Johnsons most influential accomplishment ... This is the aspect of his music that most changed the Delta blues practice and is most retained in the blues guitar tradition.\nThis technique has been called a boogie bass pattern or boogie shuffle and is described as a fifthsixth degrees of a major scale oscillation above the root chord. Sometimes it has been attributed to Johnnie Temple because he was the first to record a song in 1935 using it.  However Temple confirmed that he had learned the technique from Johnson He was the first one I ever heard use it ... It was similar to a piano boogie bass which I learned from R. L. Johnson in 32 or 33. Johnny Shines added Some of the things that Robert did with the guitar affected the way everybody played. In the early thirties boogie was rare on the guitar something to be heard. Conforth and Wardlow call it one of the most important riffs in blues music and music historian Peter Guralnick believes Johnson popularized a mode walking bass style on guitar which would rapidly become the accepted pattern. Although author Elijah Wald recognizes Johnsons contribution in popularizing the innovation he discounts its importance and adds As far as the evolution of black music goes Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note.\n\nContemporaries\nJohnsons contemporaries including Johnny Shines Johnnie Temple Henry Townsend Robert Lockwood Jr Calvin Frazier and David Honeyboy Edwards were among those who kept his music alive through performing his songs and using his guitar techniques. Fellow Mississippi native Elmore James is the best known and is responsible for popularizing Johnsons Dust My Broom. In 1951, he recast the song as a Chicagostyle blues with electric slide guitar and a backing band. According to blues historian Gerard Herhaft\n\nJohnsons influence upon Elmore Jamess music always remained powerful his falsetto voice almost shrill and the intensive use of the walking bass notes of the boogiewoogie several pieces of James repertoire were borrowed from Johnson eg Dust My Broom Rambling on My Mind and Crossroads.\nJames version is identified as one of the first recorded examples of what was to become the classic Chicago shuffle beat. The style often associated with Chicago blues was used extensively by Jimmy Reed beginning with his first record High and Lonesome in 1953. Sometimes called the trademark Reed shuffle although also associated his second guitarist Eddie Taylor it is the figure Johnson used updated for electric guitar.\n\nBlues standards\nSeveral of Johnsons songs became blues standards which is used to describe blues songs that have been widely performed and recorded over a period of time and are seen as having a lasting quality. Perone notes That such a relatively high percentage of the songs attributed to him became blues standards also keeps the legacy of Robert Johnson alive. Those most often identified are Sweet Home Chicago and Dust My Broom but also include Crossroads and Stop Breaking Down. As with many blues songs there are melodic and lyrical precedents. While Sweet Home Chicago borrows from Kokomo Arnolds 1933 Old Original Kokomo Blues Johnsons lyrics made the song a natural for Chicago bluesmen and its his version that survived in the repertoires of performers like Magic Sam Robert Lockwood and Junior Parker.In the first decades after Johnsons death these songs with some variations in the titles and lyrics were recorded by Tommy McClennan 1939) Walter Davis 1941) Sonny Boy Williamson I 1945) Arthur Crudup 1949) Texas Alexander 1950) Elmore James 1951\u20131959) Baby Boy Warren 1954) Roosevelt Sykes 1955) Junior Parker 1958) and Forest City Joe 1959). Pearson and McCulloch believe that Sweet Home Chicago and Dust My Broom in particular connect Johnson to the rightful inheritors of his musical ideasbigcity African American artists whose highpowered electrically amplified blues remain solidly in touch with Johnsons musical legacy at the time of Columbias first release of a full album of his songs in 1961In Jim ONeals statement when Johnson was inducted into the Blues Foundation Blues Hall of Fame he identified Hell Hound on My Trail Sweet Home Chicago Dust My Broom Love in Vain and Crossroads as Johnsons classic recordings. Over the years these songs have been individually inducted into the Blues Halls Classic of Blues Recording  Single or Album Track category as well as Come On in My Kitchen and Terraplane Blues.\n\nRock music\nIn the mid1950s rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry adapted the boogie pattern on guitar for his songs Roll Over Beethoven and Johnny B. Goode. Author Dave Rubin commented\n\nhis Berrys utilization of the bassstring cutboogie patterns popularized by Robert Johnson on songs like Sweet Home Chicago ... subtly altered the swing feel of the boogie blues into a more driving straight 4/4 meter while still maintaining a limber lilt that is often missing in the countless imitations that followed.\nThe pattern became one of the signature figures in early electric guitarbased rock and roll such as that of Chuck Berry and the numerous rock musicians of the 1960s who were influenced by Berry according to Perone. Although music historian Larry Birnbaum also sees the connection he wrote that Johnsons contributions to the origins of rock n roll are negligible. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Johnson as an early influence in its first induction ceremony in 1986, almost a half century after his death. It also included four of his songs it deemed to have shaped the genre Sweet Home Chicago Cross Road Blues Hellhound on My Trail and Love in Vain.Marc Meyers of the Wall Street Journal commented His Stop Breakin Down Blues from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954.Several rock artists describe Johnson as an influence\n\nEric Clapton  Robert Johnson to me is the most important blues musician who ever lived. He recorded several of Johnsons songs as well as an entire tribute album Me and Mr. Johnson 2004). Clapton feels that rather than trying to recreate Johnsons originals I was trying to extract as much emotional content from it as I could while respecting the form at the same time.\nBob Dylan  In about 1964 and 65, I probably used about five or six of Robert Johnsons blues song forms too unconsciously but more on the lyrical imagery side of things. If I hadnt heard the Robert Johnson record when I did there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut downthat I wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write. His code of language was like nothing Id heard before or since.\nRobert Plant  A lot of English musicians were very fired up by Robert Johnson to whom we all owe more or less our existence I guess in some way. Led Zeppelin recorded Traveling Riverside Blues and quoted some of Johnsons lyrics in The Lemon Song.\nKeith Richards  Ive never heard anybody before or since use the blues form and bend it so much to make it work for himself ... he came out with such compelling themes and just the way they were treated apart from the music and the performance was appealing. The Rolling Stones recorded Love in Vain and Stop Breaking Down.\nJohnny Winter  Robert Johnson knocked me outhe was a genius. He and Son House both were big influences on my acoustic slide playing. He recorded Dust My Broom with additional guitar by Derek Trucks.\n\nProblems of biography\nUntil the 2019 publication of Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlows biography Up Jumped the Devil The Real Life of Robert Johnson little of Johnsons early life was known. Two marriage licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates but Conforth and Wardlow suggest that Johnson lied about his age in order to obtain a marriage license. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother who was also Roberts mother remembered his birth date as May 8, 1911. He was not listed among his mothers children in the 1910 census giving further credence to a 1911 birthdate.  Although the 1920 census gives his age as 7, suggesting he was born in 1912 or 1913, the entry showing his attendance at Indian Creek School in Tunica Mississippi listed him as being 14 years oldFive significant dates from his career are documented Monday Thursday and Friday November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio Texas and Saturday and Sunday June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his deathJohnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release and efforts were made to discover his biography with virtually no success. A relatively full account of Johnsons brief musical career emerged in the 1960s largely from accounts by Son House Johnny Shines David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album King of the Delta Blues Singers included reminiscences of Don Law who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.\nThe blues researcher Mack McCormick began researching Johnsons family background in 1972, but died in 2015 without publishing his findings. McCormicks research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted Peter Guralnick to publish a summary in Living Blues 1982) later reprinted in book form as Searching for Robert Johnson. Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying Robert Johnson The Complete Recordings box set 1990). The documentary film The Search for Robert Johnson contains accounts by McCormick and Wardlow of what informants have told them long interviews of David Honeyboy Edwards and Johnny Shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family. Another film Cant You Hear the Wind Howl The Life  Music of Robert Johnson combines documentary segments with recreated scenes featuring Keb Mo as Johnson with narration by Danny Glover. Shines Edwards and Robert Lockwood contribute interviews. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.\n\nPhotographs\nUntil the 1980s it was believed that no images of Johnson had survived. However three images of Johnson were located in 1972 and 1973, in the possession of his halfsister Carrie Thompson. Two of these known as the dimestore photo December 1937 or January 1938) and the studio portrait summer 1936) were copyrighted by Stephen LaVere who had obtained them from the Thompson family in 1986 and 1989, respectively with an agreement to share any ensuing royalties 50% with the Johnson estate at that time administered by Thompson. The dimestore photo was first published almost in passing in an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in 1986, and the studio portrait in a 1989 article by Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow in 78 Quarterly.  Both were subsequently featured prominently in the printed materials associated with the 1990 CBS box set of the complete Johnson recordings as well as being widely republished since that time. Because Mississippi courts in 1998 determined that Robert Johnsons heir was Claud Johnson a son born out of wedlock the estate share of all monies paid to LaVere by CBS and others ended up going to Claud Johnson and attempts by the heirs of Carrie Thompson to obtain a ruling that the photographs were her personal property and not part of the estate were dismissed. In his book Searching for Robert Johnson Peter Guralnick stated that the blues archivist Mack McCormick showed him a photograph of Johnson with his nephew Louis taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph showing Louis dressed in his United States Navy uniform this picture along with the studio portrait were both lent by Carrie Thompson to McCormick in 1972. McCormick never returned the photograph of Johnson in his uniform keeping it in his archive until his death. McCormicks daughter donated the archive to the Smithsonian Institution in 2020 and encouraged museum staff to facilitate the return of the photograph to Johnsons descendants as of 2023, The Washington Post reported that the museum had agreed to return the photograph and was awaiting instructions from the Johnson family. This photograph has never been made public.\nAnother photograph purporting to show Johnson posing with the blues musician Johnny Shines was published in the November 2008 issue of Vanity Fair magazine. Its authenticity was claimed by the forensic artist Lois Gibson and by Johnsons estate in 2013, but has been disputed by some music historians including Elijah Wald Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow who considered that the clothing suggests a date after Johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched.  Further both David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood failed to identify either man in the photo.  Facial recognition software concluded that neither man was Johnson or Shines. Finally Gibson claimed the photo was from 1933 to 1934 but it is known that Johnson did not meet Shines until early 1937. In December 2015, a fourth photograph was published purportedly showing Johnson his wife Calletta Craft Estella Coleman and Robert Lockwood Jr. This photograph was also declared authentic by Lois Gibson but her identification of Johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians.  There are a number of reasons why the photograph is unlikely to be Johnson it has been proven that Craft died before Johnson met Coleman the clothing could not be prior to the late 1940s the furniture is from the 1950s the CocaCola bottle cannot be from prior to 1950, etcA third photograph of Johnson this time smiling was published in 2020.  It is believed to have been taken in Memphis on the same occasion as the verified photograph of him with a guitar and cigarette part of the dimestore set and is in the possession of Annye Anderson Johnsons stepsister Anderson is the daughter of Charles Dodds later Spencer who was married to Roberts mother but was not his father.  As a child Anderson grew up in the same family as Johnson and has claimed to have been present aged 10 or 11, on the occasion the photograph was taken. This photograph was published in Vanity Fair in May 2020, as the cover image for a book Brother Robert Growing Up with Robert Johnson written by Anderson in collaboration with author Preston Lauterbach and is considered to be authentic by Johnson scholar Elijah Wald.\n\nDescendants\nJohnson left no will. In 1998, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Claud Johnson a retired truck driver living in Crystal Springs Mississippi was the son of Robert Johnson and his only heir. The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith later Virgie Jane Cain who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931. The relationship was attested to by a friend Eula Mae Williams but other relatives descended from Robert Johnsons halfsister Carrie Harris Thompson contested Claud Johnsons claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over 1 million in royalties. Claud Johnson died aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.\n\nDiscography\nEleven 78-rpm records by Johnson were released by Vocalion Records in 1937 and 1938, with additional pressings by ARC budget labels. In 1939, a twelfth was issued posthumously. Johnsons estate holds the copyrights to his songs. In 1961, Columbia Records released King of the Delta Blues Singers an album representing the first modernera release of Johnsons performances which started the rediscovery of Johnson as blues artist. In 1970, Columbia issued a second volume King of the Delta Blues Singers Vol. II.\nThe Complete Recordings a twodisc set released on August 28, 1990, contains almost everything Johnson recorded with all 29 recordings and 12 alternate takes. Another alternate take of Traveling Riverside Blues was released by Sony on the CD reissue of King of the Delta Blues Singers. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Johnsons birth May 8, 2011, Sony Legacy released Robert Johnson The Centennial Collection a remastered 2-CD set of all 42 of his recordings and two brief fragments one of Johnson practicing a guitar figure and the other of Johnson saying presumably to engineer Don Law I wanna go on with our next one myself. One reviewer commented that the sound quality of the 2011 release was a slight improvement on the 1990 release.\n\nAwards and recognition\n1980  Blues Hall of Fame performer\n1986  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame early influence\n1990  Spin magazine first in its list of 35 Guitar Gods on the 52nd anniversary of his death\n1991  Grammy Award best historical album The Complete Recordings\n1991  Blues Music Award reissue album The Complete Recordings\n1994  US.

Johnson Legal Battle.", "Sungha Jung Korean \uc815\uc131\ud558 born 2 September 1996) is a South Korean musician who specializes in acoustic fingerstyle guitar. Jung creates acoustic covers and arrangements typically by ear andor by watching videos and composes original songs both of which he plays and uploads online. He is often described as a guitar prodigy though he prefers to be known as a guitarist rather than a prodigy. His YouTube channel currently has more than 7 million subscribers.\n\nBiography\nJung developed an interest in guitar after watching his father play. He found his fathers guitar playing more interesting than piano which he was already learning. Jungs father taught him the basics and after learning the basics he developed his skill greatly just by trying to play what he heard. When he struggled he would study online videos. Jung came to play fingerstyle when his father discovered the technique on the internet. His first idol was guitarist Kotaro Oshio from whom he developed an interest in fingerstyle guitar. At first Jungs mother and grandmother disapproved of the noise that Jung and his father continuously created but they came to understand it as his gift.\nTrace Bundy found a video of 9-yearold Sungha Jung playing Bundys version of Pachelbels Canon. After Bundy saw his cover Jung played with Bundy in tours throughout South Korea and the United States. Soon after his debut video on the internet he garnered many supporters from whom he asked for advice on his playing. His cover of The Pirates of the Caribbean theme song which has over 61 million views on YouTube as of September 2020, made Jung an internet sensation and his playing caught the attention of worldrenowned guitarists who found his covers of their songs impressive. Jung has since played on stage with them multiple times. Jung has received guitar lessons from Hata Shuji a wellknown Japanese jazz guitarist. He has also been mentored by German guitarist Ulli B\u00f6gershausen who Jung has referred to as his musical inspiration and from whom he learned much about composing and arrangingIn a video he recommended the AllEars method for those who like his style of guitar playing and want to learn it. In addition to steelstring and classical guitar he has been recorded playing twelvestring guitar electric guitar ukulele guitarlele harp ukulele and piano. He has also sung live such as when he sang Falling Slowly at a concert in Bangkok. Apart from Korean Jung speaks English which he studied to be able to communicate during concerts abroad.\n\nGuitars\nJung received his first guitar at age nine a very coarse plywood guitar that cost less than 60. Upon discovering Jungs skill with the toylike guitar his father decided to buy him a better one  a Cort Earth900. Jung began seriously playing with this guitar. His third guitar was a custommade smallcombo sized All Spruce Selma model upon which Thomas Leeb wrote KEEP ON GROOVING! TO MY FRIEND THOMAS LEEB In 2009, with the help of Ulli B\u00f6gershausen he established sponsorship from Lakewood Guitars and currently plays Lakewood Signature Model instruments. Jung mostly plays baritone guitars with a longer neck thicker strings  and deeper tuning than normal guitars.\n\nPractice and recording\nJungs daily practice time as a child was one to two hours long when there was school and up to three hours during school breaks. Jung usually takes seconds to figure out the notes and fingering to a piece and typically takes a few hours to practice before cover a piece. However to make his songs better and more accurate he occasionally spent from a couple of days up to a month practicing.\n\nPerformances\nIn 2010, Jung was featured on Narshas solo album NARSHA for the song Im in Love. In 2011 he performed in the US with Trace Bundy and also toured Scandinavia and Japan. In 2012 he collaborated with 2NE1, creating acoustic versions of the groups hit songs Lonely and I Love You. Later in 2012, he participated in a live stage with BIGBANGs GDragon where they performed That XX. He performed Im Yours with Jason Mraz who described Jung as amazing and his hero in 2013. Jung played Ahn Hyeok in the 2011 Korean movie The Suicide Forecast.\n\nAlbums\nJung released his first album Perfect Blue on 17 June 2010, his second album Irony on 21 September 2011, and his third solo album Paint It Acoustic on 15 April 2013.

He was a guitarist for the psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock and guitarist and bassist for the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1972 to 1975 and again from 1987 to 1996.\n\nStrawberry Alarm Clock\nKing was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale California.  He was one of the founding members of the LAbased Strawberry Alarm Clock a mid1960s pop psychedelic rock band. The bands largest success was with the 1967 single Incense and Peppermints which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. While with the band he played both electric guitar and bass guitar. The bands popularity waned considerably in the early 1970s. Faced with the loss of their recording contract with Uni Records and with internal conflicts over musical direction Strawberry Alarm Clock disbanded in early 1972. King opted to remain in the South inspired by an upandcoming band called Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd\nKing met the members of what was to become the Jacksonville Floridabased Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd when an earlier incarnation of the band known as The One Percent opened for Strawberry Alarm Clock in early 1968. King was so enamoured with the band that he told vocalist and leader Ronnie Van Zant that if they ever needed his services he would be happy to join. It was not until 1972 when bassist Leon Wilkeson left the band that Van Zant took King up on his offer and asked him to join Skynyrd as the bands new bassist. Wilkeson soon regretted leaving and rejoined the band and King switched to lead guitar creating with Allen Collins and Gary Rossington the tripleguitar attack that became the bands signature sound. The band referred to this unique new setup with King as the Three Guitar Army.Kings guitar playing and songwriting skills were an essential element of Lynyrd Skynyrds first three albums Pronounced L\u0115hn\u00e9rd Skinn\u00e9rd Second Helping and Nuthin Fancy. King cowrote one of the bands most recognizable hits Sweet Home Alabama and his voice counted the one two three before he launched into his famous riff to start the song. Other songs that King wrote or cowrote for Lynyrd Skynyrd include Poison Whiskey Saturday Night Special Whiskey RockaRoller and Workin for MCA. Guitarist Rossington noted years later that King was the most businessminded member of Lynyrd Skynyrd relating a story of how King would stock up on food items during stops on tour and then resell the items to his bandmates at a 500% markup when they later got hungry on the busBand biographer Mark Ribowsky wrote that King was an outsider in Lynyrd Skynyrd to some extent as he was from Southern California and the only nonSoutherner in the lineup but that it was King who brought a level of professionalism to the fledgling band. King detailed his initial exit from the band in the documentary If I Leave Here Tomorrow A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd saying Ronnie Van Zant and my guitar roadie who changed my strings were thrown in jail in Ann Arbor. They didnt arrive..until 10 minutes before we went on. I had to play on old strings and I broke two strings during Free Bird. After Ronnie was riding me and a lightbulb went off and I said Thats it. I went back to my room packed up my stuff and left. King referred to himself as a peaceful Southern California hippie and the bands predilection for drunken brawling never sat well with him the incident which led to his departure was merely the final strawKings departure in 1975 happened during a particularly difficult tour that the band dubbed the Torture Tour a tour that also claimed drummer and founding member Bob Burns weeks earlier due to a mental breakdown. The band continued with only two guitarists for a few months before discovering Steve Gaines in 1976. Gaines was killed in a plane crash along with his sister Cassie Gaines and Van Zant on October 20, 1977. Coincidentally Steve Gaines was born on the same day as King September 14, 1949.\nKing was one of the guitarists in the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987, and played a major role. He had to leave the band again in 1996 because of congestive heart failure. In 2005, Ed asked Mark Basile a long time friend and guitarist from New York to put together the remaining nontouring Skynyrd members Artimus Pyle Leslie Hawkins JoJo Billingsley and Bob Burns for several shows from 2005-2006. That band called The Saturday Night Special Band played several shows that can be found on YouTube. \nKing along with all precrash members of Lynyrd Skynyrd were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. His guitar playing influenced many subsequent musicians including Metallica bassist Cliff Burton.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2011, King underwent a successful heart transplant. In 2017, he appeared as a customer in the Discovery Channel docudrama Moonshiners buying 30,000 worth of premium ginAccording to a Nashville news station WTVF King had been battling cancer in the months prior to his death. King died in his Nashville Tennessee home on August 22, 2018, at 68 years of age. His death was announced through his personal Facebook page. Following Kings death former Lynyrd Skynyrd bandmate Rossington released a statement saying Ed was our brother and a great songwriter and guitar player. I know he will be reunited with the rest of the boys in Rock and Roll Heaven. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEd King discography at Discogs\nEd King  Biography  History  AllMusic. AllMusic.

The record was highly anticipated and propelled Deftones to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles My Own Summer Shove It and Be Quiet and Drive Far Away.\nWhite Pony was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and unprecedented commercial success. Frank Delgado had become a fulltime band member adding new elements to the bands music while Moreno himself contributed guitar lines in addition to vocals. With influences of new wave dream pop and trip hop the album is considered a turning point for the band in terms of experimentation. Singles Change In the House of Flies and Digital Bath supported the albums release. A single entitled Back to School Mini Maggit was released as a rapinfluenced reinterpretation of White Ponys closing track Pink Maggit. While commercially successful and a fan favourite the band have previously strongly objected to its publication although it is unclear whether this is still the case. White Pony was subsequently rereleased with Back to School Mini Maggit as the albums opening track. For the song Elite Deftones received the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.\nIn 2001, Moreno developed a throat injury due to heavy screaming and was forced to miss at least four shows. He suffered inflammation on his right vocal cord and partial paralysis of the left vocal cord. During the rest of their supporting tour bassist Chi Cheng took over vocal duties that required screaming while Moreno sang the softer melodies of the lyrics despite recommendations by doctors to hold off from singing to allow time for recovery as well as rumors that the band would be cancelling the remaining stretch of the tour with Godsmack and Puddle of MuddThe eponymous Deftones was released in 2003, and saw the band being praised for the heavy albums progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying Its all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we arent going to be with them. BSides  Rarities saw release in 2005, bringing together unreleased and obscure material accrued since 1995. 2006's Saturday Night Wrist was completed after a protracted and tumultuous recording process nearly leading to Morenos departure from Deftones. Later he said it had been a seriously unhealthy experience and he wasnt sure if he was going to return at the time the band was on a selfimposed hiatus. After eventually finishing the album in early 2006, Moreno claimed it to be more of a compromise between all of the members influences ranging from their brutal and brooding heavy signature seen on Adrenaline and Around the Fur to the more experimental sound heard on White Pony and Deftones. However the band saw a significant decrease on the albums first week sales compared to their two previous releases.\n\nDeftones were working on an upcoming album with the working title Eros when bassist Chi Cheng was severely injured in a car accident in November 2008, remaining in a minimally conscious state and later a partially conscious state up until his death in April 2013. In 2009, the group had recruited Sergio Vega for his replacement and announced an indefinite delay of Eros stating ... we realized that this record doesnt best encompass and represent who we are currently as people and as musicians. With Vega the group began work on a new album Diamond Eyes which was released on May 4, 2010. It saw the release of the popular singles Rocket Skates Youve Seen the Butcher and Diamond Eyes. In November 2012, Deftones released their seventh studio album titled Koi No Yokan. Leathers Tempest and Swerve City came out as its singles. 2016 saw the release of their eighth studio album Gore. In 2020 Deftones released their ninth studio album called Ohms which garnered significant critical praise.\n\nSide projects\nDuring the making of Deftones White Pony Moreno began work on a side project Team Sleep. The group released their selftitled debut album in May 2005.\nIn March 2011, Moreno stated to be working on a new side project known as Crosses featuring Far guitarist Shaun Lopez and Chuck Doom. Moreno described the project as minimal and soothing and its sort of like the stuff I like listening to when Im not screaming my head off. Their debut selftitled EP was released on August 2, 2011. EP 2 appeared the next year.\nIn April 2012 it was announced that Moreno had joined former Isis members Jeff Caxide Aaron Harris and Bryant Clifford Meyer in a side project by the name of Palms.

They released their first single through BitTorrent Bundle on April 28, 2016Moreno has also made a number of guest appearances on numerous younger groups songs such as Bender by Sevendust Paralytic by Dead Poetic Vengeance Is Mine by Droid Caviar by Dance Gavin Dance Surrender Your Sons by Norma Jean and Reprogrammed to Hate by Whitechapel. In 2009, Moreno recorded a song with Thirty Seconds to Mars to appear on their album This Is War but was not finished. On May 2, 2010, he performed The Kill with 30 Seconds to Mars.\nIn June 2016 the Secret Solstice music festival announced that Moreno would perform at Thrihnukagigur in what will be the first ever public concert inside the magma chamber of a volcano.\n\nArtistry\nThe biggest vocal influences on Moreno include Faith No Mores Mike Patton Bad Brainss HR the Smithss Morrissey and Prince. His musical influences consist of a wide range of styles and genres including the electronic bands Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark OMD Depeche Mode Thompson Twins and the Human League. Other inspirations include the Cure Bad Brains PJ Harvey the Smiths My Bloody Valentine Cocteau Twins Public Enemy Duran Duran the Smashing Pumpkins Portishead Helmet Jawbox Faith No More Slayer Hum Kool Keith Alice in Chains Tool Girls Against Boys Janes Addiction and Weezer. For Revolver he selected five nonmetal records that influenced him the Cures Pornography Heliums No Guitars Mogwais EP2, My Bloody Valentines Loveless and the Smashing Pumpkins Siamese Dream. He also made a list of his thirteen favourite albums for The Quietus containing Small Craft on a Milk Sea by Brian Eno Sunset Mission by Bohren und der Club of Gore Fever Rays selftitled album Venus Luxure No1 Baby by Girls Against Boys Turn on the Bright Lights by Interpol Youd Prefer an Astronaut by Hum Saturdays  Youth by M83, Black Noise by Pantha du Prince Love Deluxe by Sade Talkie Walkie by Air Born to Mack by Too Short The Blue Moods of Spain by Spain and Standards by TortoiseIn an August 1998 interview with Spin Moreno stated I was one of those kids who thought heavy metal was devil music. I cant say Im really a metal fan or a hip hop fan cause theres so many crappy bands out there. I just like a little bit of everything. I think other people are starting to think that way too. Regarding the influence of female artists such as PJ Harvey Moreno said he was aware that people considered him to be gay adding I really love girly stuff.In relation to his often ambiguous yet imageheavy poetic lyrics he said Sometimes my lyrics dont deal with specific topics. I write down on paper the feelings of the moment its not easy to explain the contents of the lyrics or give a logical sense to the words. What I write is also a reaction to the music we make so the Deftones sound is not pop it doesnt communicate happy feelings. Paradoxically my favorite songs of the album talk about love in a clearly different view.\n\nCollaborations\nMoreno also featured in the lowbudget video for the song Carpe Diem by fellow Sacramento hardcore act Will Haven. In 2007, he produced their album The Hierophant.\nMoreno makes a brief cameo in Limp Bizkits alternate video for their 1997 single Counterfeit seen on the singles bonus disc.\n\nPersonal life\nMoreno has been married twice.

In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary Backstreet RecordsIn early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album which would become Hard Promises was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of 998, following Steely Dans Gaucho and the Olivia NewtonJohnElectric Light Orchestra Xanadu soundtrack. This socalled superstar pricing was 100 more than the usual list price of 898. Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Nondelivery of the album and naming it Eight NinetyEight were considered but eventually MCA decided against the price increaseIn 1987, Petty sued tire company BF. Goodrich for 1 million for using a song very similar to his song Marys New Car in a TV commercial.

A judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting further use of the ad and the suit was later settled out of court. Petty also disallowed George W. Bush from using I Wont Back Down for his 2000 presidential campaign. His family would do the same for Donald Trump in 2020, stating Tom Petty would never want a song of his used for a campaign of hate.Some outlets have claimed that the Red Hot Chili Peppers single Dani California released in May 2006, bears a close musical similarity to Pettys Mary Janes Last Dance. Petty told Rolling Stone I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock n roll songs sound alike. Ask Chuck Berry. The Strokes took American Girl for their song Last Nite and I saw an interview with them where they actually admitted it. That made me laugh out loud. I was like OK good for you ... If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously then maybe Id sue. But I dont believe in lawsuits much. I think there are enough frivolous lawsuits in this country without people fighting over pop songs.In January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and Jeff Lynne would receive royalties from Sam Smiths song Stay with Me after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and I Wont Back Down. Petty and cocomposer Lynne were each awarded 125% of the royalties from Stay with Me and their names were added to the ASCAP song credit. Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him saying All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen.

He was the vocalist and lyricist of protopunk band The Stooges who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since. Often called the Godfather of Punk he was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR. In 2010, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Stooges. Pop also received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020, for his solo workInitially playing a raw primitive style of rock and roll progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances which often involved acts of selfmutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career beginning with the Stooges album Raw Power in 1973. Both musicians went to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums The Idiot and Lust for Life Pop usually contributing the lyrics. Throughout his career he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics poetic lyrics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stagedive and popularized the activity. Pop who traditionally but not exclusively performs barechested also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowdPops music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career including garage rock punk rock hard rock heavy metal art rock new wave grunge jazz blues and electronic. Though his popularity has fluctuated many of Pops songs have become well known including Search and Destroy and I Wanna Be Your Dog by the Stooges and his solo hits Lust for Life The Passenger and Real Wild Child Wild One. In 1990, he recorded his only Top 40 US. hit Candy a duet with B52's singer Kate Pierson. Pops song China Girl became more widely known when it was rerecorded by cowriter Bowie who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album Lets Dance 1983). Bowie rerecorded and performed many of Pops songs throughout his career.\nAlthough Pop has had limited commercial success he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges album Raw Power has proved an influence on artists such as Sex Pistols the Smiths and Nirvana. His solo album The Idiot has been cited as a major influence on a number of postpunk electronic and industrial artists including Depeche Mode Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division and was described by Siouxsie Sioux as a reaffirmation that our suspicions were true the man is a genius.\n\nEarly life\nJames Newell Osterberg was born in Muskegon Michigan on April 21, 1947, the son of Louella n\u00e9e Christensen 1917\u20131996) and James Newell Osterberg 1921\u20132007) an English teacher and baseball coach at Fordson High School in Dearborn Michigan. He is of English German and Irish descent on his fathers side and Danish and Norwegian ancestry on his mothers side. His father was adopted by a SwedishAmerican nurse surnamed Osterberg. The family lived in a trailer park in Ypsilanti Michigan. Ron Asheton later described him as having been a conventional teenager He hung out with the popular kids that wore chinos cashmere sweaters and penny loafers. Iggy didnt smoke cigarettes didnt get high didnt drink.Osterberg began to play drums in the fifth grade first starting with rubber pads glued to plywood before his parents bought him a drum set. In a 2007 Rolling Stone interview he explained his relationship with his parents and their contribution to his music\n\nOnce I hit junior high in Ann Arbor I began going to school with the son of the president of Ford Motor Company with kids of wealth and distinction. But I had a wealth that beat them all. I had the tremendous investment my parents made in me. I got a lot of care. They helped me explore anything I was interested in. This culminated in their evacuation from the master bedroom in the trailer because that was the only room big enough for my drum kit. They gave me their bedroom.\n\nMusic career\nEarly days 1960\u20131967\nOsterberg began his music career as a drummer in various high school bands in Ann Arbor Michigan including The Iguanas who covered several records such as Bo Diddleys Mona in 1965. He then began exploring local bluesstyle bands such as the Prime Movers with brothers Dan and Michael Erlewine which he joined at 18 years old. The Prime Movers gave him the nickname Iggy for having played in The Iguanas. According to biographer Jim Ambrose the two years he spent in the band made him aware of art politics and experimentation.Osterberg eventually dropped out of the University of Michigan and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago he played drums in blues clubs helped by Sam Lay formerly of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band who shared his connections with Pop. Inspired by Chicago blues as well as bands like The Sonics MC5 and The Doors he formed The Psychedelic Stooges. The band was composed of Osterberg on vocals Ron Asheton on guitar Ashetons brother Scott on drums and Dave Alexander on bass. Their first show was played at a Halloween party at a house in Detroit Michigan. Members of the MC5 were also in attendance. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few a covers band believing Ive never met a convincing musician that didnt look kind of ill and kind of dirty and Ron had those two things covered! The three nicknamed Osterberg Pop after local character Jim Popp whom he resembled.\n\nThe Stooges era 1968\u20131974\nThe seeds of Pops stage persona were sown when he saw the Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and antagonism displayed by singer Jim Morrison. Morrisons extreme behavior while performing in a popular band inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pops vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown\n\nI attended two concerts by the Doors. The first one I attended was early on and they had not gotten their shit together yet. That show was a big big big influence on me. They had just had their big hit Light My Fire and the album had taken off. ... So heres this guy out of his head on acid dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled. The stage was tiny and it was really low. It got confrontational. I found it really interesting. I loved the performance ... Part of me was like Wow this is great. Hes really pissing people off and hes lurching around making these guys angry. People were rushing the stage and Morrisons going Fuck you. You blank blank blank. You can fill in your sexual comments yourself. The other half of it was that I thought If theyve got a hit record out and they can get away with this then I have no fucking excuse not to get out on stage with my band. It was sort of the case of Hey I can do that. There really was some of that in there.\nIn addition to Jim Morrison and The Doors influence on the band Pop also attributes the Stooges getting jumpstarted after seeing an allgirls rock band from Princeton New Jersey called The Untouchable. In a 1995 interview with Bust he relates\n\nAnd the other thing was we went to New York. We had gone to New York a couple of months before that just to check out the scene and we had never been to a place like New York ... we went down around Eighth Street there where all the young tourists hang out and we met these girls from New Jersey from Princeton they had a band called The Untouchable and were like Oh youve got a band sure ha ha ha and they said Well come to our house and see us play. And we didnt have anywhere to crash and they played for us and they completely rocked and we were really ashamed.\nIn 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbed the Psychedelic Stooges the band signed with Elektra Records again following in the footsteps of The Doors who were Elektras biggest act at the time according to Pop guitarist Ron Asheton called Moe Howard to see if it was all right to call the band The Stooges to which Howard responded by merely saying I dont care what they call themselves as long as theyre not The Three Stooges! and hung up the phone. Pop himself told the story in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch documentary film about The Stooges Gimme Danger. The Stooges first album The Stooges on which Pop was credited as Iggy Stooge was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the followup Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition expected it was later ranked No. 191 in Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. Shortly after the release of Fun House the group disbanded because of Pops worsening heroin addiction.\n\nIn 1971, without a record deal the Stooges kept performing in small clubs with a fivepiece lineup that included both Ron Asheton and James Williamson on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass Pop having fired Dave Alexander the previous year when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism. That year Pop and David Bowie met at Maxs Kansas City a nightclub and restaurant in New York City. Pops career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with him in England. With Williamson signed on as guitarist the search began for a rhythm section. However since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England they decided to reunite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark Raw Power. After its release Scott Thurston was added to the band on keyboardselectric piano and Bowie continued his support but Pops drug problem persisted. The Stooges last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of bikers documented on the album Metallic KO. Drug abuse stalled Pops career again for several years.\n\nBowie and Berlin 1976\u20131978\nAfter the Stooges second breakup Pop made recordings with James Williamson but these were not released until 1977 as Kill City credited jointly to Pop and Williamson. Pop was unable to control his drug use and checked himself into a mental institution the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors continuing to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took Pop as his companion on the Station to Station tour. This was Pops first exposure to largescale professional touring and he was impressed particularly with Bowies work ethic. Following a March 21, 1976, show Bowie and Pop were arrested together for marijuana possession in Rochester New York although charges were later droppedBowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. Living in a Berlin apartment with Bowie and his friends was interesting Pop recalled. The big event of the week was Thursday night. Anyone who was still alive and able to crawl to the sofa would watch Starsky  Hutch.In 1977, Pop signed with RCA Records. Bowie helped write and produce The Idiot and Lust for Life Pops two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist the latter featuring one of his bestknown songs The Passenger. Lust for Life featured another team of brothers Hunt and Tony Fox Sales sons of comedian Soupy Sales. Among the songs Bowie and Pop wrote together were China Girl Tonight and Sister Midnight all of which Bowie performed on his own albums later the last being recorded with different lyrics as Red Money on Lodger. Bowie also played keyboards in Pops live performances some of which are featured on the album TV Eye Live in 1978. In return Pop contributed backing vocals on Bowies Low.Artistically I really like those two records The Idiot and Lust for Life Pop said. But I was personally just miserable David was a really good friend to me in many ways but he had his whole thing going on and a whole apparatus of people around him and problems that he had to face. For more than year I lived in the room next door and I had a good friendship but it wasnt the same as being in a band.\n\nArista albums 1979\u20131981\nPop had grown dissatisfied with RCA later admitting that he had made TV Eye Live as a quick way of fulfilling his threealbum RCA contract. He moved to Arista Records under whose banner he released New Values in 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion with James Williamson producing and latterday Stooge Scott Thurston playing guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly the albums style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges. New Values was not a commercial success in the US. but has since been highly regarded by critics.\nThe album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand however and this led to Pops first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne he made a memorable appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporations nationwide show Countdown. During his anarchic performance of Im Bored Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was lipsynching shoving the microphone down his pants at one point and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by host Molly Meldrum an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of Gday mate in a mock Australian accent. His Countdown appearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the shows history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand Pop recorded a music video for Im Bored and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer. While in Australia Pop was also the guest on a live latenight commercial TV interview show on the Ten Network. The Countdown appearance has often been rescreened in Australia.\nDuring the recording of Soldier 1980) Pop and Bowie argued with Williamson over various aspects of the project. Williamson recalled I was not at all happy with a number of aspects of that record including the band the material and the recording facilities. So I was unhappy in general and vice versa. Williamson left the project. Bowie appeared on the song Play it Safe performing backing vocals with the group Simple Minds. During a live performance in Brooklyn in 1981, Pop smashed a microphone into his own face knocking out a front tooth.\nBoth Soldier and its followup Party 1981) were commercial failures and Pop was dropped from Arista.\n\n1980s\nIn 1980, Pop published his autobiography I Need More cowritten with Anne Wehner an Ann Arbor arts patron. The book which includes a selection of black and white photographs featured a foreword by Andy Warhol. Warhol wrote that he met Pop when he was Jim Osterberg at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. I dont know why he hasnt made it really big Warhol wrote. He is so good.The 1982 album Zombie Birdhouse on Chris Steins Animal label with Stein himself producing was no more commercially successful than his Arista works. In 1983, Pops fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song China Girl. The song had originally appeared on The Idiot and was a major hit on Bowies blockbuster Lets Dance album. As cowriter of the song Pop received substantial royalties. On Tonight in 1984, Bowie recorded five more of their cowritten songs 2 from Lust for Life 1 from New Values and 2 new songs assuring Pop financial security at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a threeyear break during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classesAdditionally Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 film Repo Man with Steve Jones previously of the Sex Pistols on guitar and Nigel Harrison and Clem Burke both of Blondie on bass and drums as well as an instrumental called Repo Man Theme that was played during the opening creditsIn 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop 1986's new waveinfluenced BlahBlahBlah featuring the single\nReal Wild Child a cover of The Wild One originally written and recorded by Australian rock n roll musician Johnny OKeefe in 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world especially in Australia where it has been used since 1987 as the theme music for the ABCs latenight music video show Rage. BlahBlahBlah was Pops highestcharting album in the US. since The Idiot in 1977, peaking at No. 75 on the Billboard 200 chart.\nAlso in 1985, Pop and Lou Reed contributed their singing voices to the animated film Rock  Rule. Pop performed the song Pain  Suffering in the final sequence of the filmIn 1987, Pop appeared along with Bootsy Collins on a mostly instrumental album Neo Geo by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. The music video for Risky written and directed by Meiert Avis won the first MTV Breakthrough Video Award.  The groundbreaking video explores transhumanist philosopher FM2030's ideas of Nostalgia for the Future in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of Man Rays models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from Jean Baudrillard Edvard Munchs 1894 painting Puberty and Roland Barthes Death of the Author. The surrealist blackandwhite video uses stop motion light painting and other retro incamera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score for The Last Emperor in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Pop who performs the vocals on Risky chose not to appear in the video allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.\nPops followup to Blah Blah Blah Instinct 1988) was a turnaround in musical direction. Its strippedback guitarbased sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him but the King Biscuit Flower Hour radio show recorded the Instinct tour featuring guitarist Andy McCoy and Alvin Gibbs on bass in Boston on July 19, 1988.

Both of her parents turned to religion after a wild youth. Perry has English German Irish and Portuguese ancestry. Through her mother she is a niece of film director Frank Perry. She has a younger brother named David who is also a singer and an older sister AngelaFrom ages three to 11, Perry frequently moved across the country as her very strict parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up she attended religious schools and camps including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years. The family struggled financially sometimes using food stamps and eating food from the food bank which also fed the congregation at her parents churchGrowing up Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word luck reminded their mother of Lucifer and were also required to call deviled eggs angeled eggs. Perry primarily listened to gospel music as secular music was generally discouraged in the familys home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. Perry later recalled a story about how a friend of hers played You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette which impacted her songwriting and singingWhile not strictly identifying as religious she has stated I pray all the time  for selfcontrol for humility.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Until the bands disbandment in 1996, Johnny along with the lead vocalist Joey Ramone were the only two original members who stayed since its inception.\nIn 2009, Ramone appeared on Times list of The 10 Greatest ElectricGuitar Players. He ranked No. 8 on Spins 2012 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time and No. 28 on Rolling Stones similarly titled 2015 list. Alongside his music career Ramone appeared in nearly a dozen films in documentaries and on television. Ramones autobiography Commando was released posthumously in 2012.\n\nEarly life\nJohn William Cummings was born in Queens New York City on October 8, 1948, the only child of Estelle a waitress of Polish and Ukrainian descent and Francis William Cummings a construction worker a steamfitter of Irish descent. He was raised in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens where he grew up absorbing rock music. Cummingss father was a strict disciplinarian. Johnny is quoted as saying My father would get on these tangents about how he never missed a days work. I broke my big toe the day I had to go pitch a Little League game and hes going What are you  a baby? What did I do raise a baby? You go play. And even though my toe was broken I had to go pitch the game anyway. It was terrible.As a teenager Cummings played in a band called the Tangerine Puppets alongside future Ramones drummer Tam\u00e1s Erd\u00e9lyi better known as Tommy Ramone. Cummings was known as a greaser though he was later described as a tiedyewearing Stooges fan. He was a lifelong New York Yankees fan. Cummings also worked as a plumber with his father before the Ramones became successful. At one point he attended Peekskill Military Academy in Peekskill New York.\n\nCareer\nRamones\nCummings met future bandmate Douglas Colvin later to become Dee Dee Ramone in the early 1970s while delivering dry cleaning. They would eat lunch together and discuss their mutual love of bands like the Stooges and MC5. Together they went to Mannys Music in New York City in January 1974, where Johnny bought a used blue Mosrite Ventures II guitar for just over 54. On the same trip Dee Dee bought a Danelectro bass. They collaborated with future bandmate Jeffrey Hyman later to become Joey Ramone to form the Ramones with Richie Stern on bass. Stern left after a few rehearsals. Thomas Erd\u00e9lyi later to be Tommy Ramone joined the Ramones in the summer of that year after public auditions failed to produce a satisfactory drummer. The members of the band each used the Ramone surname and Cummings became known as Johnny RamoneThe Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The bands debut album Ramones was greeted positively by rock critics. The album was not a commercial success reaching only number 111 on the Billboard album chart. Their next two albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia were released in 1977. Rocket to Russia was the bands highestcharting album to date reaching number 49 on the Billboard 200. In 1978, the band released their fourth studio album Road to Ruin. It failed to reach the Billboard Top 100. However I Wanna Be Sedated which appeared both on the album and as a single would become one of the bands bestknown songs. The artwork on the albums cover was done by Punk magazine cofounder John HolmstromAfter the bands movie debut in Roger Cormans Rock n Roll High School 1979) renowned producer Phil Spector became interested in the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century. There is a longdisputed rumor that during the recording sessions in Los Angeles Spector held Johnny at gunpoint forcing him to repeatedly play a riffPleasant Dreams the bands sixth album was released in 1981. It continued the trend established by End of the Century taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records. Johnny would contend in retrospect that this direction was a record company decision a continued futile attempt to get airplay on American radio.\nSubterranean Jungle produced by Ritchie Cordell and Glen Kolotkin was released in 1983. According to Trouser Press it brought the band back to where they once belonged junky 60s pop adjusted for current tastes which among other things meant easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once Ramones dogma.Johnny Ramone was responsible for initiating one of the major sources of animosity within the band when he began dating and later married Linda Daniele who had previously dated Joey Ramone. Though the band remained together for years after this incident relations between Johnny and Joey remained strainedThe Ramones performed 2,263 concerts touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. On August 6, 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival they played a farewell concert at the Palace in Hollywood and disbandedRecognition of the bands importance grew over the years. The Ramones ranked number 26 in Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and number 17 in VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the secondgreatest band of all time by Spin trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommys replacement on drums Marky Ramone were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nActing\nAlongside his music career Johnny Ramone appeared in nearly a dozen films including Rock n Roll High School and documentaries. He also made television appearances in such shows as The Simpsons 1F01 Rosebud 1993) and Space Ghost Coast to Coast Episode 5 Bobcat.In 2001, Johnny appeared in an Englishlanguage Spanish science fiction film called Stranded.\n\nGuitar technique\nBeing almost exclusively a rhythm guitarist Johnny Ramone mostly used downstrokes throughout his career he also used full sixstring barre chords and occasional power chords. This unique technique combined with his characteristic tone from his guitar amp produced a guitar sound that was far more aggressive and rhythmic than that of his contemporaries heavily influencing early punk rock groupsJohnny saw himself as a rhythm guitarist. For the most part he disliked lengthy guitar solos and consequently never attempted to gain much skill in this area of playing. Despite this Johnny did play simple lead guitar parts on a small number of Ramones recordings such as Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue and California Sun. A brief guitar solo can also be found on live versions of I Cant Make It on Time in which Johnny plays a descending E minor pentatonic scale ending it off with a whole step bend. However the infrequent guitar solos on the groups studio albums were usually overdubbed by Tommy Ramone Ed Stasium Daniel Rey Walter Lure and other uncredited guests. Most of these small leads were only added in an attempt to give certain songs a more commercial appeal they were not common on the bands albums.\n\nFor example Dictators bassist Andy Shernoff states that Jimmy Pages rapid downstroke guitar riff in Communication Breakdown an influential song that contained elements of protopunk was an inspiration for Johnny Ramones downstroke guitar style. Ramone who has described Page as probably the greatest guitarist who ever lived stated in the documentary Ramones The True Story that he improved his downstroke style by playing the song over and over again for the bulk of his early career. Recording engineer Ed Stasium once stated Johnny makes it sound simple but I cant do it and I bet Eddie Van Halen cant. Not for an hour!. His style has also been an influence on many alternative rock bands as well as on thrash metal performers such as James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett of Metallica Dave Mustaine of Megadeth and Scott Ian of Anthrax. Guitar virtuoso Paul Gilbert has cited Johnny Ramone as one of his influences.\n\nPolitics\nJohnny was one of the few conservatives in the punk rock community and was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party. He made his political affiliation known to the world in 2002 when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After thanking all who made the honor possibleclad in his trademark Tshirt ripped blue jeans and leather jackethe said God bless President Bush and God bless America.

Shortly after the trip Slovak moved out of the groups shared house to live with his girlfriend.\n\n1982\u201388: What is This? stint Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time What Is This? had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment he left them to concentrate on What Is This. Flea ultimately respected the decision but felt the band would suffer musically without him and Irons. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons and Slovaks places respectively.  During the recording of the second What Is This? album Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time as the group was dissatisfied with Slovaks replacement Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Shermans guitar work didnt have the same spirit that Slovak contributed to the bands sound.  When Flea asked Kiedis how he felt about Slovak rejoining the band Kiedis responded by saying Id give my firstborn son to get him back in the band. After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.\nSlovak returned to the Chili Peppers for their second album Freaky Styley which was released on August 16, 1985. What Is This? had finally disbanded and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. The relationship between Flea Slovak and Kiedis began to deteriorate as a result of excessive heavy drug use and addiction. Flea recalled that it began to seem ugly to me and not fun our communication was not healthy. Kiedis became dependent on heroin leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the albums material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. When Slovak was under the influence he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a shuffling fashion which became the inspiration for the song Skinny Sweaty Man from the bands next album.  After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album he reflected in his diary It was so fun. Im so extremely proud of everybodys workit is at times genius. Slovak was the subject of the songs Skinny Sweaty Man Me and My Friends  No Chump Love Sucker. He was nicknamed Slim Bob Billy Slim or Huckleberry and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo.  On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan Slovak experimented with different musical styles playing the sitar on the song Behind the Sun.\n\nHealth decline\nSlovak and Kiedis became addicted to heroin early on in their careers and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family. At first the band were more concerned about Kiedis addiction which had become more apparent to the other members due to his willingness to openly discuss his issues. Kiedis was more upfront about his problems while Slovak according to Kiedis was much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise.  During the tour in support of Freaky Styley Slovaks health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour but Slovak became too weak to participate. Kiedis commented on the situation I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force that allows you to at least defend yourself.  It was a sad moment.  A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovaks health contacted his brother James who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroinDeciding to give sobriety a chance both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using drugs prior to their European tour in support of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and decided to help each other steer clear of heroin. An entry from Slovaks diary on January 21, 1988, discusses his attempts to begin a new drugfree phase of life. During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar.  He recovered a few days later but was briefly kicked out of the band and replaced by DeWayne McKnight for a few shows.  After a few days with McKnight the band decided to give Slovak another chance and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour. Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help.\n\nDeath\nUpon returning home Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates and struggled to resist drug abuse without the support of his friends and Kiedis in particular. He stopped painting and writing in his diary during this time and little is known about his life during the weeks following the tour aside from a phone call to his brother on June 24, in which Slovak told him that he was having difficulty staying clean despite his desire to stop taking heroin.  A few weeks after the band returned from the tour the members attempted to contact Slovak but were unable to do so for several days.  Slovak died in his Hollywood apartment on June 25, 1988 although his body was not discovered until two days later. On June 27, 1988, Slovaks body was found slumped over the painting he had been working on at the time of his death he was found holding a cigarette which had burnt a hole in the canvas of the painting. After completion of the autopsy authorities confirmed that the official cause of death was due to an accidental heroin overdose. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills CaliforniaFollowing his death Kiedis fled town and did not attend the funeral considering the situation to be surreal. Although he found the death to be a shock he was not initially scared straight and continued to use heroin.  However a few weeks later his friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovaks grave which inspired him to get clean. Irons was unable to cope with his death and subsequently left the band saying that he did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of his friends. Irons has suffered from severe depression since his death. This did not end Irons musical career however as he would work with Johannes on several projects including the band Eleven and would join Pearl Jam for a period in the 1990s after initially declining to join the band upon its founding. Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music hoping to continue what he helped build. They hired DeWayne McKnight and DH. Peligro as replacements who were later replaced by Chad Smith and John Frusciante.\n\nMusical style and legacy\nSlovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix Santana and Led Zeppelin.  His playing method was markedly based on improvisation a style commonly used in funk music.  He was also noted he would often play with such force that his fingers would come apart.  Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring sultry elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.  On Uplift Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal.  His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the groups songs with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work.  His melodic riff featured in the song Behind the Sun inspired the group to create pretty songs with an emphasis on melody.  Kiedis describes the song as pure Hillel inspiration.  Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as Green Heaven and Funky Crime in which the sounds of his amplified guitar would be played through a tube into his mouth and then back into a microphone creating psychedelic voicelike effects.  Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the groups work including adding occasional drum machines. Despite the fact that the group billed itself as The Organic AntiBeat Box Band Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instrumentsSlovaks work was one of the major contributing factors to Red Hot Chili Peppers early sound. When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak Kiedis likened the experience to shopping for a new Mom and Dad because of his influence over the band.  Flea who originally listened exclusively to jazz added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music saying that it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin. He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante who would later replace him as guitarist in the band. Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovaks work and explained I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillels playing and I just took it sideways from there.  Just like Slovak before him Frusciante developed a heroin addiction. Unlike Slovak Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit. The songs Knock Me Down from Mothers Milk My Lovely Man from Blood Sugar Sex Magik This is the Place from By the Way and Feasting on the Flowers from The Getaway were written about or as tributes to Slovak. The title of the song Otherside from Californication is also a tribute to Slovak. The bands 1987 cover version of Jimi Hendrixs song Fire recorded with Slovak and previously only released on the Fight Like a Brave single and The Abbey Road EP was included on 1989's Mothers Milk along with an image of one of Slovaks paintings inside the albums booklet. In 1999, a book titled Behind the Sun The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published. The book was authored by Slovaks brother James Slovak and features writings from his brothers diaries paintings photos and handwritten notes from Kiedis and Flea.\nOn December 7, 2011, Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Slovaks brother James accepted the award on his behalf and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with Rolling Stone Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovaks induction explaining Hes a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didnt make it out of the 1980s and he is getting honored for his beauty.  Flea echoed those comments on the same day Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much he hasnt been here for some time but I know how much it would mean to him. Its a powerful thing.\n\nDiscography\nWith Addie BrikWattsland  EP  1984)With What Is ThisSqueezed  EP  1984)\nWhat Is This?  1985)\n3 Out Of 5 Live  EP  1985)With Red Hot Chili PeppersThe Red Hot Chili Peppers  1984)\nCowrote Get Up and Jump Green Heaven Out in LA. and Police Helicopter\nFreaky Styley  1985)\nThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan  1987)\nThe Abbey Road EP.  1988)\nMothers Milk  1989)\nPerforms on only one track Fire\nWhat Hits?  1992)\nOut in LA.  1994)\nUnder the Covers Essential Red Hot Chili Peppers  1998)\nThe Best of Red Hot Chili Peppers  1994)\n\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nApter Jeff 2004).

Following the formation of Roses band Hollywood Rose in 1983, the bands demo tape featured two songs cowritten by Rose and Tobias Shadow of Your Love and Back Off Bitch. In 1985, Rose formed Guns N Roses and released their debut album Appetite for Destruction in 1987. While Shadow of Your Love was rerecorded during the albums sessions it did not make the final album but Tobias was thanked in the albums credits. The song was later released as a Bside of the albums first single Its So EasyMr. Brownstone.In 1991, a rerecorded version of Back Off Bitch was featured on Guns N Roses third studio album Use Your Illusion I. Rose stated in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1992 that the song was ten years old at that time. In late 1994, Tobias joined Guns N Roses as a replacement for Gilby Clarke and played rhythm and lead guitar on the bands cover version of Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil. While Tobias contributed to the song on Roses request his inclusion caused friction between Rose and the bands thenlead guitarist Slash due to an overdub made by Tobias of Slashs solo on the songTobias would go on to work and record with Guns N Roses in 1996, when the band started working on their sixth studio album. His role in the band was not clarified publicly at the time as it was uncertain if he would eventually feature on the album and subsequent tours as a rhythm guitarist. Rose further explained that the intention of bringing in Tobias was to help the band in the studio\n\nThe public gets a different story from the other guys  Slash Duff Matt  who have their own agendas. The original intentions between Paul and myself were that Paul was going to help me for as long as it took to get this thing together in whatever capacity that he could help me in. So when he first was brought into this he was brought in as a writer to work with Slash. At the time those guys never suggested one name.\nIn 1997, Tobias began working for Guns N Roses fulltime in a studio setting jamming and recording song ideas with keyboardist Dizzy Reed and thenlead guitarist Robin Finck among others. During these sessions Tobias and Reed wrote the song Oh My God which was later featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 film End of Days. In January 2001, Tobias made his live debut with Guns N Roses as the band played their first concerts in eight years at Las Vegass House of Blues and Rock in Rio III. Rose introduced Tobias on stage in both shows as someone who had helped him keep the band together during the past years. In Rio Rose also noted that Tobias had previously played live only a handful of times. The band played their next two concerts in December 2001, also in Las Vegas which were Tobias last appearances as a band member.\nIn mid2002, due to his aversion to touring Tobias was replaced in the band by Richard Fortus. At the time it was not officially stated that Tobias had left Guns N Roses. During that same year Tobias other band Mank Rage expressed interest in releasing an album consisting of material recorded prior to his tenure with Guns N Roses. In July 2006, several of the bands demos were posted on MySpace. In 2008, Guns N Roses released Chinese Democracy and Tobias was credited as a cowriter on seven songs in addition to contributing arrangements and guitar and piano parts. In 2018, Tobias was again associated with Guns N Roses when Shadow of Your Love was released as a single and included on the deluxe edition of Appetite for Destruction. He received further writing credits for the bands singles Hard Skool and Perhaps released in 2021 and 2023 respectively.\n\nDiscography\nWriting and instrumental credits\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nPaul Tobias discography at Discogs \nPaul Tobias at AllMusic", "Keith Lionel Urban  born Urbahn 26 October 1967) is an Australian and American country singer guitarist and songwriter.

He is a former member of the rock band Kiss from 1982 until mid1984 during the bands transition out of their 1973\u20131983 makeup period. Vincent was the last member to wear a unique makeupcostume configuration as the character of The Ankh Warrior a design created by Paul Stanley until he and the band were first shown without the makeup during an interview on MTV in September 1983. He founded his own band Vinnie Vincent Invasion which had minor hits in the hair metal genre.\n\nEarly life\nVincent John Cusano was born in Bridgeport Connecticut the son of Theresa Terri Ferraro and Alfonso Cusano musicians. Both of his parents were of Italian descent. He picked up the guitar at an early age and was inspired by bluegrass and rock and roll. Cusanos first introduction to working with internationally renowned artists was working with Felix Cavaliere mostly widely known from The Rascals and their hit Good Lovin\u200a as part of the band Treasure.  This resulted in an album of the same name being released on Epic Records in 1977. It was recorded in New York City at Sound Ideas recording studios   In 1980, Vincent moved to Los Angeles California where he became a staff songwriter for the television series Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi. Many of the series songs were written on Vincents acoustic guitar while sitting at the Cunninghams kitchen table on the Happy Days set during offtime from the shows rehearsal schedule. Vincent has said the times of working at the Paramount lot were genuinely happy days. According to the site Kiss Related Recordings Vincent has played with Dan Hartman as well as the bands Hunter Warrior Hitchhikers and Heat going as far back as 1970.\n\nCareer\nKiss\nAfter being introduced to the band by songwriter Adam Mitchell Vincent was brought in as the replacement for guitarist Ace Frehley. Vincents personality meshed well with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley thus enabling him to play lead guitar on six of the nine tracks on the Creatures of the Night album as well as cowriting three. After a commercially disappointing Creatures of the NightTenth Anniversary tour that finished on a high at what ended up being the last makeup show and Kiss largest crowd attendance at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium Rio de Janeiro Brasil Vincent returned to the studio with Kiss to record the Lick It Up album. His work was productive yielding eight cowrites out of the ten songs on the album a record for any member until Bruce Kulicks nine out of 12 on Carnival of Souls and Stanleys 10 out of 13 on Monster.\nThough contributing to Creatures of the Night as a session player before being named as Frehleys replacement in December 1982, Vincent for all the public knew was the official guitarist in Kiss and played all the lead guitar tracks on Lick it Up. In what was a frequent occurrence for former guitarist Frehley a ghost player was asked to play on the album with Rick Derringer recording the solo on the opening track.\nThough Vincent performed well live with Kiss he refused to sign an employment contract which strained the relationship with SimmonsStanley. This arose because of disputes over his role in the band and pay some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for and was flatly denied a percentage of the bands gross profits. Consequently Vincent never formally became a member of the band. This ultimately led to him leaving after the North American leg of the Lick It Up tour. He was replaced by Mark St. John. Despite parting on bad terms Vincent was later used by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album Revenge contributing to the songs Unholy Heart Of Chrome and I Just Wanna. Vincent again fell out of favor with Simmons and Stanley as they claimed that Vincent again began making all kinds of crazy demands and pulling the same kind of crazy stuff all over again.In 2022, Kiss released a super deluxe multi disc version of the Creatures of the Night album which featured demos and outtakes with Vincent as guitarist and songwriter as well as two full CDs of live recordings from the Creatures of the Night10th Anniversary Tour the first officially released live recordings with Vinnie Vincent.\n\nVinnie Vincent Invasion\nFollowing his departure from Kiss in mid1984, Vincent used the money he made from his tenure in the band to take a long vacation traveling the world for a full year and visiting places like Tahiti Philippines Mozambique India and Europe including a visit to the small town of Mora in Dalarna Sweden. That same year Vincent was hospitalized for mental health related issues and also wrote songs and recorded demos of his new songs intended for Kiss with drummer Hirsh Gardner Then he formed the band Vinnie Vincent Invasion with among others former Journey singer Robert Fleischman in the mid1980s and released two studio albums Vinnie Vincent Invasion in 1986 and All Systems Go in 1988. The band broke up in 1989. After that the bands singer Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum formed Slaughter.\n\nLater career\nIn 1996, Vincent released a solo EP from the studio sessions he did in 1990 some say 1989\u201391) called Euphoria once again with Robert Fleischman on vocals. Vincent as well as playing all the guitars played bass and did the drum programming under the guise of V. Meister. Andre LaBelle provided drum tracks to the CD but they were replaced by Vincents drum programming. LaBelle can be heard on various tracks on the bootleg GuitarmaggedonGuitars from Hell CD that featured five more songs than the Euphoria EPA tribute album entitled Kiss My Ankh A Tribute To Vinnie Vincent was released by SplitScreen Entertainment on August 27, 2008. The album consists of new recordings of songs from Vincents careers with Kiss and the Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Featured artists include Steve Brown of Trixter Troy Patrick Farrell of White Lion TJ.

When we first came to London together he burned all my clothes and redressed me from head to toe. I dont care much about clothes whereas hes always very interested in them. He has given me selfconfidence encourages me to talk to people not to be afraid and to use the abilities I have. Morten is actually the only one in Norway who had as much ambition as I did. I guess we both have big egos. In a way were each sitting in our own little world while Mags is more down to earth. Mags often has to mediate between Morten and me.. Its good that were so different and still respect each other. The tension between us is creative. No one sings like Morten.

He can keep working on what appears to be the same thing over and over again. While I go crazy when I have to go over a song hundreds of times he can sit with it for hours trying to find exactly the right mix to achieve the sound he wants. P\u00e5l is really the driving force behind aha. Hes one of the few real artists on the pop rock scene.

He was born with a paralysed left eye and underwent five eye operations by the age of six. According to Yorke the last surgery was botched giving him a drooping eyelid. He decided against further surgery I decided I liked the fact that it wasnt the same and Ive liked it ever since. And when people say stuff I kind of thought it was a badge of pride and still do.The family moved frequently. Shortly after Yorkes birth his father a nuclear physicist and later a chemical equipment salesman was hired by a firm in Scotland. The family lived in Lundin Links until Yorke was seven and he moved from school to school. The family settled in Oxfordshire in 1978, where Yorke attended primary school in StandlakeYorke said he knew he would become a rock star after seeing the Queen guitarist Brian May on television for the first time at the age of eight. He initially wanted to be a guitarist rather than a singer but began singing as he had no one else to sing the songs he was writing. He received his first guitar as a child. At 10, he made his own guitar inspired by Mays homemade Red Special. By 11, he had joined his first band and written his first song.

At school he performed a vocal recital of a Schubert piece which helped him find the confidence to become a singer. Terence GilmoreJames the Abingdon director of music recalled Yorke as forlorn and a little isolated thanks to his unusual appearance but talkative and opinionated. He said Yorke was not a great musician unlike his future bandmate Jonny Greenwood but a thinker and experimenter. Yorke later credited the support of GilmoreJames and the head of the art department for his success.\n\n1985\u20131991: On a Friday\nIn sixth form at Abingdon Yorke played with a punk band TNT but left when he was dissatisfied with their progress. He began playing with the students Ed OBrien Philip Selway and Colin Greenwood joined later by Colins younger brother Jonny. In 1985, they formed a band On a Friday named after the only day they were allowed to practice.

In the late 1980s Yorke made a solo album Dearest which OBrien described as similar to the Jesus and Mary Chain with delay and reverb effectsOn the strength of their first demo On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records but the members decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. Yorke had wanted to apply to St Johns to read English at the University of Oxford but he said I was told I couldnt even apply  I was too thick. Oxford University would have eaten me up and spat me out. Its too rigorous. He also considered studying music but could not read sheet musicIn late 1988, Yorke left Oxford to study English and fine arts at the University of Exeter. On a Friday entered hiatus aside from rehearsals during breaks. At Exeter Yorke performed experimental music with a classical ensemble played in a techno group called Flickernoise and played with the band Headless Chickens performing songs including future Radiohead material.

According to Yorke his paintings at Exeter were shit he was rejected by his classmates and went AWOL for three months. Yorke credited his art school education for preparing him creatively for his later workOn a Friday resumed activity in 1991 as most of the members were finishing their degrees. Ronan Munro the editor of the Oxford music magazine Curfew gave the band their first interview while they were sharing a house in Oxford. He recalled Thom wasnt like anyone Id interviewed before ... He was like This is going to happen.. Failure is not an option. ... He wasnt some ranting diva or a megalomaniac but he was so focused on what he wanted to do.\n\nCareer\n1991\u20131993: Creep and rise to fame\nIn 1991, when Yorke was 22, On a Friday signed to EMI and changed their name to Radiohead.

Yorke grew tired of Creep after it became a hit and told Rolling Stone in 1993: Its like its not our song any more ... It feels like were doing a cover.According to Yorke around this time he hit the selfdestruct button pretty quickly. He tried to project himself as a rock star and drank heavily often becoming too drunk to perform. Yorke said When I got back to Oxford I was unbearable ... As soon as you get any success you disappear up your own arse. Years later Yorke said he had found it difficult to cope with Radioheads success I got angry ... I got more controlfreakery. I put my hands on the steering wheel and I was whiteknuckled and I didnt care who I hurt or what I said. He later apologised to his bandmates for his behaviour.\n\n1994\u20131997: The Bends\nPaul Q Kolderie the coproducer of Pablo Honey observed that Yorkes songwriting improved dramatically after Pablo Honey. OBrien later said After all that touring on Pablo Honey ... the songs that Thom was writing were so much better. Over a period of a year and a half suddenly bang.Recording Radioheads second album The Bends 1995) was stressful as they felt pressured to release a followup to Creep. Yorke in particular struggled. According to the bands comanager Chris Hufford Thom became totally confused about what he wanted to do what he was doing in a band and in his life and that turned into a mistrust of everybody else. The Bends was engineered by Nigel Godrich who became one of Yorkes longestrunning collaboratorsThe Bends received critical acclaim and brought Radiohead wider international attention. It influenced a generation of British and Irish alternative rock acts The Observer wrote that it popularised an angstladen falsetto which eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound.

Yorke befriended the REM. singer Michael Stipe who gave him advice about how to deal with fame. Yorke joined REM. to perform their song EBow the Letter on several occasions from 1998 to 2004.\n\n1997\u20131998: OK Computer\nDuring the production of Radioheads third album OK Computer 1997) the members had differing opinions and equal production roles with Yorke having the loudest voice according to OBrien.

Colin Greenwood described the hundredyard stare in Yorkes eyes when performing and said he absolutely did not want to be there.. You hate having to put your friend through that experience. Yorke said later\n\nWhen I was a kid I always assumed that fame was going to answer something  fill a gap. And it does the absolute opposite. It happens with everybody. I was so driven for so long like a fucking animal and then I woke up one day and someone had given me a little gold plate for OK Computer and I couldnt deal with it for ages.\nIn 1997, Yorke provided backing vocals for a cover of the 1975 Pink Floyd song Wish You Were Here with Sparklehorse. The following year he duetted on El President with Isabel Monteiro of Drugstore and sang on the Unkle track Rabbit in Your Headlights a collaboration with DJ Shadow.

In 2016, Pitchfork wrote that Yorke weirdly comes off as the weak link with understated vocals that did not resemble the Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.\n\n1999\u20132004: Kid A Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief\nFollowing the OK Computer tour Yorke suffered a mental breakdown and found it impossible to write new music.  He experienced imposter syndrome and became selfcritical and overanalytical. He was approached to score the 1999 film Fight Club but declined as he was recovering from stressAround this period acts influenced by Radiohead emerged such as Travis and Coldplay. Yorke resented them feeling they had copied him. He said in 2006: I was really really upset about it and I tried my absolute best not to be but yeah it was kind of like that sort of thing of missing the point completely. Godrich felt Yorke was oversensitive and told him he did not invent guys singing in falsetto with an acoustic guitar. He saw Yorkes resentment as a byproduct of being so focused on what he wanted to do that he figures hes the only person thats ever had that idea.To recuperate Yorke moved to Cornwall and spent time walking the cliffs writing and drawing. He restricted his songwriting to piano the first song he wrote was Everything in Its Right Place. During this period Yorke listened almost exclusively to the electronic music of artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre saying It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as Id ever felt about guitar music. Yorke gradually relaxed and came to enjoy his work againRadiohead took Yorkes electronic influences to their next albums Kid A 2000) and Amnesiac 2001) processing vocals obscuring lyrics and using electronic instruments such as synthesisers drum machines and samplers.

He stressed that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made with their blessing. According to Jonny Greenwood Radiohead were happy for Yorke to make the album Hed go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus. Godrich said that working with Yorke on The Eraser was easier than working with Radiohead as when we were in a room when its with Radiohead ... Im trying to manage a relationship between Yorke and the band and its me butting heads with him and trying to work on behalf of the band.The Eraser was released in 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings backed by the singles Harrowdown Hill which reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart and Analyse.

His solo work comprises mainly electronic music. Stereogum characterised it as largely interior frigid and beatdriven unlike the wideopen horizons of Radiohead songsYorke said the nature of being a creative person was to retain a beginners mind. The search is the point. The flailing around is the point. The process is the point. Yorke said he used to be more controlling in the studio but learnt to be more relaxed and open to new ideas. He likened the creative process to surfing You can sit out there on a board for ages waiting for the right wave to come along. You cant get angry about it. You know it will happen eventually and you start to understand the waiting itself might be part of it.Yorke has worked with the producer Nigel Godrich on most of his projects including Radiohead Atoms for Peace the Smile and most of his solo work. Yorke credits Godrich with helping edit his work identifying which parts need improvement and which have potential. He said they sometimes had arguments that last for days but that they always resolve their differences and likened him to a brother. Godrich said the pair were very productive together and thats a really precious and important thing and it changes within the context of whatever were doing.\n\nInstruments\nYorke is a multiinstrumentalist and plays instruments including guitar piano bass and drums. He played drums for performances of the 2007 Radiohead song Bangers and Mash. With the Smile Yorke has used a Fender Mustang bass with a fingerstyle techniqueYorke uses electronic instruments such as synthesisers drum machines and sequencers and electronic techniques including programming sampling and looping. In 2015, he said Really I just enjoy writing words sitting at a piano. I tend to lose interest in the drum machine. According to Godrich Thom will sit down and make some crazy fractured cheesegrateronhead mayhem on a computer but at some point he always gets his guitar out to check he can actually play it.Unlike his bandmate Jonny Greenwood Yorke does not read sheet music he said You cant express the rhythms properly like that. Its a very ineffective way of doing it so Ive never really bothered picking it up. Explaining why he turned down a request to play piano on the song Mr. Bellamy on Paul McCartneys album Memory Almost Full 2007) Yorke said The piano playing involved two hands doing things separately. I dont have that skill available. I said to him I strum piano thats it.\n\nVocals\nYorke has one of the widest vocal ranges in popular music. He is known for his falsetto which Paste described as sweet cautious and haunting. Rolling Stone described his voice as a broad emotive sweep with a high keening sound. The Guardian described it as instrumentlike and spectral and wrote that it transcends the egocentric posturing of the indie rock singer stereotype. The music journalist Robert Christgau wrote that Yorkes voice has a pained transported intensity pure up top with hints of hysterical grit below ... Fraught and selfinvolved with no time for jokes not asexual but otherwise occupied and never ever common this is the idealised voice of a pretentious college boy ... Like it or not the voice is remarkable.Yorke often manipulates his voice with software and effects transforming it into a disembodied instrument. For example on Everything in Its Right Place 2000) his vocals are treated to create a glitching stuttering collage. Pitchfork wrote in 2016 that over the decades Yorkes voice had evolved from semiinteresting altrocker to leftfield artrock demigod to electronic grand wizard. In 2006, Yorke said It annoys me how pretty my voice is. That sounds incredibly immodest but it annoys me how polite it can sound when perhaps what Im singing is deeply acidic. He said he keeps vocals in mind whenever he builds music no matter the genre and that he found it difficult to listen to dance music without imagining a voice. In 2023, Yorke said that his vocal range had dropped with age and that he now found Creep difficult to singIn 2005, readers of Blender and MTV2 voted Yorke the 18thgreatest singer of all time. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked him the 66thgreatest and wrote that he was one of the most influential singers of his generation influencing bands such as Muse Coldplay Travis and Elbow. In their updated 2023 list Rolling Stone ranked Yorke the 34thgreatest singer praising his genuine edge of alienation.\n\nLyrics\nYorkes early lyrics were personal but he found that tortured lyrics became tired. He said his lyrics were not some deep heartfelt thing instead he likened them to a collage assembled from images and external sources such as television. From Kid A he experimented with cutting up words and phrases and assembling them at random. He sometimes chooses words for their sounds rather than their meaning such as the title phrase of Myxomatosis or the repeated phrase the rain drops on Sit Down. Stand Up. A 2021 study found that Yorke had among the largest vocabularies of pop singers based on the number of different words used in each songYorke deliberately uses cliches idioms and other common expressions inspired by the American artist Barbara Kruger. For example according to the Pitchfork writer Rob Mitchum the Kid A lyrics feature humdrum observations twisted into panic attacks. Another Pitchfork writer Jayson Greene said the approach suggested a mind consumed by meaningless data. Yorke said he hoped to capture the experience people have every day of trying to make emotional sense of the words and images that surround them and that lyrics should be a series of windows opening rather than shutting which is incredibly hard to do. Colin Greenwood described his lyrics as a running commentary on whats happening in the world ... like a shutter snapping in succession.The New Republic writer Ryan Kearney speculated that Yorkes use of common expressions which he described as Radioheadisms was an attempt to sap our common tongue of meaning and expose the vapidity of everyday discourse. Kearney felt the approach had become a crutch for Yorke creating a senseless mush. He wrote in 2016 that he was the most overrated lyricist in music today and that fans critics and academics had taken the bait and delivered one overwrought interpretation after another.Yorke said his lyrics were motivated by anger expressing his political and environmental concerns and written as a constant response to doublethink. The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what Yorke called the ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding war on terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 single Harrowdown Hill about David Kelly the British weapons expert and whistleblower. In a 2008 television performance of House of Cards Yorke dedicated the denial denial refrain to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. The 2011 single The Daily Mail attacks the rightwing Daily Mail newspaperMany of Yorkes lyrics express paranoia. The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis described what you might call the Yorke worldview that life is a waking nightmare and everything is completely and perhaps irreparably screwed. In a 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot Yorke said In the 60s you could write songs that were like calls to arms and it would work ... Its much harder to do that now. If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. Its not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someones mind. Working on Radioheads ninth album A Moon Shaped Pool Yorke worried that political songs alienated some listeners but decided it was better than writing another loveydovey song about nothing.Greene wrote that Yorkes lyrics on A Moon Shaped Pool were less cynical conveying wonder and amazement. Many critics felt the lyrics might address Yorkes separation from Rachel Owen his partner of more than 20 years. However Yorke denied writing biographically saying he instead writes spasmodic lyrics based on imagery.\n\nDance\nYorke often incorporates dance into his performances described by the Sunday Times as his onstage signature. He began dancing on stage after Radiohead released Kid A in 2000, as many songs did not require him to play guitar. The New York Times contrasted Yorkes tortured 1990s appearance with his later looser more comfortable performances. Yorke said he enjoyed messing around with the idea of being the rock star or the uptight 1990s guy. I can choose to do something completely different and be stupid or jump around.Yorkes dancing features in music videos for songs such as Lotus Flower and Ingenue and the short film Anima. Critics have described it as erratic flailing and unconventional. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers voted Yorke their 10thfavourite dancing musician.\n\nInfluences\nAs a child Yorkes favourite artists included Queen REM Siouxsie and the Banshees Joy Division and Bob Dylan were important to him as a teenager. He initially attempted to emulate singers including Michael Stipe Morrissey and David Sylvian. He also wrote that Mark Mulcahy of Miracle Legion had affected him a great deal at this time It was the voice of someone who was only truly happy when he was singing ... It changed the way I thought about songs and singing.When he was 16, Yorke sent a demo to a music magazine who wrote that he sounded like Neil Young. Unfamiliar with Young Yorke purchased his 1970 album After the Gold Rush which gave him the confidence to reveal softness and naivet\u00e9 in vocals. Yorke also credited Young as a lyrical influence. He said It was his attitude toward the way he laid songs down. Its always about laying down whatever is in your head at the time and staying completely true to that no matter what it is. Yorke said that Jeff Buckley had given him the confidence to use falsetto and be vulnerable in his singingYorke cited the Pixies Bj\u00f6rk and PJ Harvey as artists who changed his life and in 2006 he told Pitchfork that Radiohead had ripped off REM. blind for years. He cited Stipe as his favourite lyricist I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful. The chorus of How to Disappear Completely from Kid A was inspired by Stipe who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself Im not here this isnt happening. Yorke cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante as an influence on his guitar playing on In Rainbows and Scott Walker as an influence on his vocals and lyrics. Yorke admired how the Beastie Boys worked independently despite being signed to a major record label and was influenced by their activism such as their Tibetan Freedom ConcertsAfter OK Computer Yorke and Radiohead incorporated influences from electronic artists such as Aphex Twin and Autechre. In 2013, Yorke cited Aphex Twin as his biggest influence saying He burns a heavy shadow ... Aphex opened up another world that didnt involve my fucking electric guitar ... I hated all the music that was around Radiohead at the time it was completely fucking meaningless. I hated the Britpop thing and what was happening in America but Aphex was totally beautiful.\n\nArtwork\nSince the EP My Iron Lung 1994) Yorke has created artwork for Radiohead and his other projects with Stanley Donwood. The pair met as art students at the University of Exeter. Donwood said his first impression of Yorke was that he was mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with. Yorke is credited for artwork alongside Donwood as the White Chocolate Farm Tchock Dr. Tchock and similar abbreviationsWhereas Donwood described himself as having a tendency towards detailing and perfectionism he said Yorke is completely opposed fucking everything up ... I do something then he fucks it up then I fuck up what hes done ... and we keep doing that until were happy with the result. Its a competition to see who wins the painting which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way. The artist Tarik Barri provides live visuals for Yorkes solo and multimedia projects and shows with Atoms for Peace.\n\nPolitics and activism\nMusic industry\nYorke has been critical of the music industry and has pioneered alternative release platforms with Radiohead and his solo work. Following Radioheads tour of America in 1993, he became disenchanted with being right at the sharp end of the sexy sassy MTV eyecandy lifestyle he felt he was helping sell. After a 1995 Melody Maker article suggested that Yorke would kill himself like the Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain Yorke developed an aversion to the British music press. In November 1995, NME covered an incident in which Yorke became sick and collapsed on stage at a show in Munich and titled the story Thommys Temper Tantrum. Yorke said it was the most hurtful thing anyone had written about him and refused to give interviews to NME for five yearsThe 1998 documentary Meeting People Is Easy portrays Yorkes disaffection with the music industry and press during Radioheads OK Computer tour. After Radioheads fourth album Kid A 2000) was leaked via the peertopeer filesharing software Napster weeks before release Yorke told Time he felt Napster encourages enthusiasm for music in a way that the music industry has long forgotten to do. I think anybody sticking two fingers up at the whole fucking thing is wonderful as far as Im concerned. In 2001, Yorke criticised the American live music industry describing it as a monopoly controlled by Clear Channel Entertainment and TicketmasterAfter Radioheads record contract with EMI ended with the release of Hail to the Thief 2003) Yorke told Time I like the people at our record company but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And yes it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say Fuck you to this decaying business model. In 2006, he called major record labels stupid little boys games  especially really high up.Radiohead independently released their 2007 album In Rainbows as a download for which listeners could choose their price. Yorke said the most exciting part of the release was the removal of the barrier between artist and audience. However in 2013, Yorke told the Guardian he feared the In Rainbows release had instead played into the hands of content providers such as Apple and Google They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up but in doing so they have made all content including music and newspapers worthless in order to make their billions. And this is what we want? In 2015, he criticised YouTube for seizing control of contributor content likening it to Nazis looting art during World War II.\n\nSpotify\nIn 2013, Yorke and Godrich made headlines for their criticism of the music streaming service Spotify and removed Atoms for Peace and Yorkes solo music from the service. In a series of tweets Yorke wrote Make no mistake new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it ... New artists get paid fuckall with this model. Yorke called Spotify the last gasp of the old industry accusing it of only benefiting major labels with large back catalogues and encouraged artists to build their own direct connections with audiences insteadBrian Message a partner at Radioheads management company disagreed with Yorke noting that Spotify pays 70 percent of its revenue back to the music industry. He said that Thoms issue was that the pipe has become so jammed ... We encourage all of our artists to take a longterm approach ... Plan for the long term understand that its a tough game. Yorkes music was readded to Spotify in December 2017For Yorkes second solo album Tomorrows Modern Boxes 2014) released via BitTorrent he and Godrich expressed their hope to hand some control of internet back to people who are creating the work ... bypassing the selfelected gatekeepers. Asked if the release had been a success Yorke said No not exactly ... I wanted to show that in theory today one could follow the entire chain of record production from start to finish on his own. But in practice it is very different. We cannot be burdened with all of the responsibilities of the record label.\n\nClimate change\nIn 2000, during the recording of Kid A Yorke became obsessed with the Worldwatch Institute website which was full of scary statistics about icecaps melting and weather patterns changing. He said he became involved in the movement to halt climate change after having children and waking up every night just terrified.In 2003, Yorke became a spokesperson for the environmental organisation Friends of the Earth and their Big Ask Campaign. He said this was a difficult decision as it exposed him to personal attacks and that journalists harassed his friends and family for personal details. In an article for the Guardian Yorke wrote that he initially felt he would be a poor match as his touring consumed a large amount of energy. However Friends of the Earth persuaded him that this was ideal as they did not want to present a holierthanthou message. He accepted that he would be criticised for his supportIn 2006, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed at the Big Ask Live a 2006 benefit concert to persuade the British government to enact a new law on climate change. That year Yorke refused an invitation from Friends of the Earth to meet the prime minister Tony Blair. Yorke said that Blair had no environmental credentials and that his spin doctors would manipulate the meeting. He told the Guardian that Blairs advisers had wanted to vet him and that Friends of the Earth would lose access if he said the wrong thing which he equated to blackmail. Yorke also found it unacceptable to be photographed with Blair because of his involvement in the Iraq WarIn 2008, Radiohead commissioned a study to reduce the carbon expended on tour. Based on the findings they chose to play at venues supported by public transport made deals with trucking companies to reduce emissions used new lowenergy LED lighting and encouraged festivals to offer reusable plastics. That year Yorke guestedited a special climate change edition of Observer Magazine and wrote Unlike pessimists such as James Lovelock I dont believe we are all doomed ... You should never give up hope.In 2009, Yorke performed via Skype at the premier of the environmentalist documentary The Age of Stupid and gained access to the COP 15 climate change talks in Copenhagen by posing as a journalist. In 2010, he performed a benefit concert at the Cambridge Corn Exchange for the British Green Party and supported the 10:10 campaign for climate change mitigation. The following year he joined the maiden voyage of Rainbow Warrior III a yacht used by Greenpeace to monitor damage to the environmentYorke endorsed the Green Party candidate Caroline Lucas at the 2015 UK general election. In December 2015, he performed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris at a benefit concert in aid of 350org an environmental organisation raising awareness about climate change. His performance was included on the live album Pathway to Paris released in July 2016. Yorke contributed an electronic track Hands Off the Antarctic to a 2018 Greenpeace campaign.\n\n2017 Israel concert\nIn April 2017, more than 50 prominent figures including the musicians Roger Waters and Thurston Moore the rights activist Desmond Tutu and the filmmaker Ken Loach signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel a performance in Israel as part of Boycott Divestment and Sanctions a cultural boycott of Israel. In a Rolling Stone interview Yorke said of the criticism I just cant understand why going to play a rock show or going to lecture at a university is a problem to them ... Its really upsetting that artists I respect think we are not capable of making a moral decision ourselves after all these years. They talk down to us and I just find it mindboggling that they think they have the right to do that.Yorke said that the petitioners had not contacted him. This was disputed by Waters who wrote in an open letter in Rolling Stone that he had attempted to contact Yorke several times. In a statement Yorke responded Playing in a country isnt the same as endorsing the government. Music art and academia is about crossing borders not building them about open minds not closed ones about shared humanity dialogue and freedom of expression.\n\nOther issues\nIn 1999, Yorke travelled to the G8 summit to support the Jubilee 2000 movement calling for cancellation of thirdworld debt. In a 2003 Guardian article criticising the World Trade Organization he wrote The west is creating an extremely dangerous economic environmental and humanitarian time bomb. We are living beyond our means. In 2005, he performed at an allnight vigil for the Trade Justice Movement calling for a better trade deal for poor countriesIn 2002, Yorke performed at the Bridge School Benefit a charity concert organised by the Canadian songwriter Neil Young one of Yorkes influences. His set included a cover of Youngs 1970 song After the Gold Rush performed on the piano Young wrote it on. In September 2004, Yorke was a key speaker at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament rally outside the Fylingdales air base in Yorkshire protesting Tony Blairs support of the Bush administrations plans for the Star Wars missile defence system. In 2011, alongside Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack and Tim Goldsworthy of Unkle Yorke played a secret DJ set for a group of Occupy activists in the abandoned offices of the investment bank UBSTo celebrate the 2008 election of US president Barack Obama Yorke released a remixed version of his single Harrowdown Hill as a free download. After the election of Donald Trump in 2016, he tweeted lyrics from Radioheads single Burn the Witch interpreted as a criticism of Trumps policies. In June 2016, following the Orlando nightclub shooting in Florida Yorke was one of nearly 200 music industry figures to sign an open letter published in Billboard urging the United States Congress to impose stricter gun control. He opposed Brexit and in March 2019 joined the Peoples Vote march calling for a second referendumYorke is vegetarian. In a 2005 film for the animal rights foundation Animal Aid he said Society deems it necessary to create this level of suffering in order for people to eat food that they dont need ... You should at least be aware of what youre doing rather than assuming that thats your right as a human being to do it.\n\nPersonal life\nFor 23 years Yorke was in a relationship with the artist and lecturer Rachel Owen whom he met while studying at the University of Exeter. In 2012, Rolling Stone reported that Owen and Yorke were not married. However The Times later found that they had married in a secret ceremony in Oxfordshire in May 2003. Their son Noah was born in 2001, and their daughter Agnes in 2004On Yorkes 2018 soundtrack album Suspiria Agnes collaborated on the artwork and Noah played drums on two tracks. In September 2021, Noah released a song Trying Too Hard Lullaby. NME likened its ghostly arrangement to Radioheads album In Rainbows. Noah has since released several songs and is due to release an EP Cerebral Key. He also performs with James Knott as the noise duo Hex GirlfriendIn August 2015, Yorke and Owen announced that they had separated amicably. Owen died from cancer on 18 December 2016, aged 48.

Stephen was the father of Stevie Young who in later years took over from Malcolm in ACDCYoung himself took up the guitar at the age of five or six receiving one lesson from Alexander after which he was selftaught. Young also learned how to fight on Cranhills tough streets and on one occasion was struck by a carPrompted by the worst winter on record in Scotland and TV advertisements offering assisted travel for families to immigrate to Australia the Youngs flew from Scotland to Sydney Australia in late June 1963. John migrated to Australia separately from his parents and siblings while Alexander was the only child to remain in the UK\u200a6\u20137\u200aInitially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Nissen huts brother George met and became friends with another migrant Harry Vanda a relationship that grew into their professional careers in musicYoungs family moved into a semidetached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood. Young attended Burwood Public School from 1960 to 1966 and in 1967, attended Ashfield Boys High School dropping out at age 15. While at high school Young enjoyed only the art classes. He practised the guitar in his bedroom after schoolAfter high school Young worked at various jobs including night shifts at a butcher shop. Then he became an apprentice printer. For one week a soft porn magazine called Ribald moved into the print shop where Young worked. Young set some type for that magazine but despite some claims was never its employeeYoung first started playing on a banjo restrung with six strings. Youngs first guitar was a cheap acoustic model purchased secondhand by his mother. After high school and with a pay packet Young bought his first Gibson SG secondhand around 1970 from a music shop just down the street from his home I got out and got a Gibson SG that I played until it got wood rot because so much sweat and water got into it. The whole neck warped. I bought it secondhand it was about a 67. It had a real thin neck really slim like a Custom neck. It was dark brown.\n\nCareer\nBoth Young and Malcolm were in a band with George and his music partner Harry Vanda called Marcus Hook Roll Band. The project released an album in Australia called Tales of Old Grand DaddyPrior to forming ACDC Angus Young played in a local group called Kantuckee. Kantuckees lineup included Bob McGlynn vocals Angus Young guitar Jon Stevens bass and Trevor James drums. The band split and was later called Tantrum with the following line up Mark Sneddon vocalsguitar Angus Young guitar Jon Stevens bass and Trevor James drums.\nYoung was 18 when he and Malcolm formed ACDC in 1973. Young was on lead guitar Malcolm on rhythm guitar Colin Burgess on drums Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals. The band had a recording contract with Albert Productions it had also produced the work of the Easybeats.Can I Sit Next To You Girl the bands first single was later rerecorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name ACDC suggested by their sister Margaret who saw the letters ACDC on the back of her sewing machineYoung tried a number of stage costumes such as SpiderMan Zorro a gorilla and a parody of Superman named SuperAng before settling on his signature schoolboy look at the suggestion of his sister. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was created by his sister Margaret and when it fell apart from wear and tear he used his uniform from Ashfield Boys High School in SydneyACDC released their debut album High Voltage exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975, along with a single Baby Please Dont Go  Love Song. Over the next three years ACDC cemented themselves as a popular hard rock act especially in Australia with the followup albums TNT Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Let There Be Rock and Powerage. All their albums until this point were produced by Youngs brother George in partnership with Harry Vanda. Their 1979 studio album Highway to Hell became their bestselling at the time and launched them to new heights of fame.\nMonths after this Scott died from alcohol poisoning. Questions were raised as to whether the band could continue without him. Young and his other bandmates soon decided they should finish the work they had begun for their new album so they recruited exGeordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Five months later Back in Black was released as a tribute to Scott. It quickly became a huge success far outselling any of their previous albums and going on to reach 22x multiplatinum in the US alone and selling 50 million copies the second highestselling album worldwide behind only Michael Jacksons Thriller. ACDCs next album For Those About to Rock We Salute You cemented their position as the most popular hard rock act of the time.\nACDCs popularity declined with their next three albums Flick of the Switch Fly on the Wall and Blow Up Your Video. ACDC looked as though they had reached their peak early in the 1980s and by the end of the decade were in decline. Malcolm Young missed the majority of the bands 1988 Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address his drinking problem. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young.\nThe bands 1990 studio album The Razors Edge brought them back into the spotlight reaching 5x multiplatinum in the US alone and selling between 10 and 12 million copies worldwide. Over the next 10 years ACDC released two other studio albums Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip which confirmed their renewed popularity and success. After a lengthy eightyear hiatus ACDC returned with a new studio album Black Ice in 2008. Black Ice debuted at number 1 in 29 countries and was certified multiplatinum in 14 of those becoming one of their most successful albums worldwide and was followed by a hugely successful world tour. In 2010, ACDC released an album of songs used for the Iron Man 2 soundtrack they had put together this reached number one in many countries around the world including the UK and number four in the US. Malcolm Young confirmed in 2011 that ACDC were working on a 16th studio album.\nIn April 2014 Malcolm was forced to leave the band due to ill health leaving Young the sole continuous founding member left in the band. In May it was revealed that Stevie Young Malcolm and Youngs nephew would stand in for his uncle to record ACDCs latest record. In September Malcolm officially retired and Stevie was made ACDCs official fulltime rhythm guitarist. ACDC released Rock or Bust in the fall of 2014. In March 2016, after the departure of both Malcolm Young and drummer Phil Rudd ACDC was set back with yet another departure long time lead singer Brian Johnson was ordered by doctors to stop performing or face total hearing loss. Young determined to finish what the band started recruited Guns N Roses singer Axl Rose to stand in for Johnson for the remainder of the Rock or Bust World Tour. On 30 September 2020, the bands official Twitter account announced the pending release of a new album Power Up with the lineup of Angus Young Stevie Young Brian Johnson Cliff Williams and Phil RuddIn 2003, ACDC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the following year they were ranked number 72 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. VH1 ranked them number 23 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and number 4 in their list of the 100 greatest artists of hard rock.\n\nPersonal life\nYoung is married to a Dutch woman named Ellen van Lochem. They own homes in Australia the UK and the NetherlandsA heavy smoker Young is a teetotaler and has been all his lifeOn 24 August 2006, Young received Kerrang! magazines Legend Award from the editor Paul Brannigan who called ACDC one of the most important and influential rock bands in history. On 16 May 2012, he was named the Best Australian Guitarist of All Time in a poll conducted by Australian Guitar Magazine.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nYoung has used Gibson SGs in various forms throughout his career. His original and the basis for his current signature model was a 1969\u20131971 SG Standard. One of his original SGs was given a lightningbolt fingerboard during a repair by luthier John Diggins and remained his most prominent studio guitar. His primary stage guitar is a 1967 ebony SG Standard. Diggins made at least one more SG for Young under his own Jaydee brand nameAt least two of his SGs whether modified Gibson product or groundup construction circa 1977 and the Paris Let There Be Rock tapings featured onboard wireless going to his amplifiers the circuitry installed in a cavity routed into the back of the body. This practice was discontinued due to the potential for electrical shorts due to sweat and at least one of these guitars was repaired and used for the Rock or Bust tourGibson made a custom SG for Young with lightning bolt inlays to replace the Jaydee SG. Youngs 69\u201371 SG has T Top humbucking pickups. Another 1964 SG which he used on the recording of Ballbreaker has patent  pickups. All of these are vintageoutput Alnico II or V pickups with matched coils typically reading 75k78k DCR. Beginning in 2009, Young started fitting Seymour Duncan humbuckers to all of his touring guitars. He uses Ernie Ball Super Slinky guitar strings .009-.042) and Fender Extra Heavy picks.\n\nAngus Young SG\nYoung and Gibson Guitar Corporation have collaborated to make the Angus Young SG. It features a pickup designed by Young himself the Angus Young Signature Humbucker in the bridge position and a 57 Classic Humbucker in the neck. The neck has lightning bolt inlays.\n\nAmplifiers\nYoung mainly uses Marshall 1959 100 watt Super Lead Plexi heads and model 1960 AX and BX 4x12 cabinets with Celestion G12-65 speakers. Later amplifiers included Marshall JMP 2203 and most recently Wizard Amplifiers. Early wireless systems the SchafferVega Diversity System that he began using in 1977, was also used as a compressor and a booster in his signal to fatten up his tone. Ever since adding it to his rig it was used on several albums in the studio for chosen rhythm guitar tracks and all lead guitar tracks. Beginning with Rock or Bust due to the discontinuation of the Schaffer system Young began using a replica of the units preamp with a commercial wireless unit from Shure.\n\nInfluences\nYoung has stated that he first began playing guitar when he was little teeny. I would sort of dabble around five or six years old. Thats when I started hearing Little Richard.In an interview with The Guitar Show Young noted his influences include his brother Malcolm Chuck Berry Freddie King and Muddy Waters while playing licks relating to Jimi Hendrix Pete Townshend John Lee Hooker and the Kinks You Really Got Me.Young has indicated that he was also influenced by Keith Richards as well as Chuck Berrys performing style including his banter with audiences and duck walk. When the band covered Chuck Berry songs in their early years audiences would recognise the song while noting their renditions were very different from the source material.\n\nStyle\nYoungs playing style is influenced by straight blues playing in both the minor and major pentatonic twelve bar bluestype progressions. In ACDCs earlier recordings power chords can be heard in songs such as TNT. and Its a Long Way to the Top If You Wanna Rock n Roll. He also utilises touches of Scottish folk in his playing and pulloff arpeggios pulloffs played onehanded are a popular trick appearing in songs such as Who Made Who Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Sin City and live renditions of Let There Be Rock. In 1976, the band recorded an instrumental arrangement of the Scottish traditional song Loch Lomond retitled Fling Thing which has appeared in their stage act over the years. The title refers to the Highland Fling. Young occasionally provides backing vocals along with Malcolm on songs such as TNT. and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.\nYoung is famous for his wild onstage antics such as intense jumps and running back and forth across the stage. Once he would clamber onto Bon Scotts or Brian Johnsons shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on Youngs back while he played an extended improvised guitar solo usually during the song Rocker with Scott or Let There Be Rock with Johnson. He frequently does his own version of Chuck Berrys duck walk as well as a spasm during which he throws himself to the ground kicking shaking and spinning in circles while playing the guitar. In earlier years he might remove his jacket and shirt midsong as a form of striptease to the confused bemusement of the crowdYoung was advised by older brother George that if he ever tripped over his guitar cable to keep playing and make it look like part of the act. Young also included a sort of striptease as part of a midshow ritual during which he slowly took off his schoolboy outfit running across the stage to elicit cheers from the audience culminating in a mooning gesture to expose his underwear generally chosen with the colours of the local flag or occasionally offering a brief glimpse of his bare buttocks. He would then pull up his shorts grab his guitar and play the remainder of the show topless. According to ACDC video director David Mallet although Young performs many of his trademark feats sometimes from a series of platforms risers and ramps he suffers from a fear of heights. This was discovered when Mallet chose to have Young lowered from a second story balcony onto a stage floor by wires for the video for Who Made Who.\n\nDiscography\nMarcus Hook Roll Band\nTales of Old Grand Daddy 1973 Australia 1978 America 2014 international\n\nACDC\nHigh Voltage 1975, Australia only\nTNT. 1975, Australia only\nHigh Voltage 1976, International version\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap 1976)\nLet There Be Rock 1977)\nPowerage 1978)\nIf You Want Blood Youve Got It 1978)\nHighway to Hell 1979)\nBack in Black 1980)\nFor Those About to Rock We Salute You 1981)\nFlick of the Switch 1983)\nFly on the Wall 1985)\nWho Made Who 1986)\nBlow Up Your Video 1988)\nThe Razors Edge 1990)\nBallbreaker 1995)\nStiff Upper Lip 2000)\nBlack Ice 2008)\nIron Man 2 2010)\nRock or Bust 2014)\nPower Up 2020)\n\nAwards and nominations\nAPRA Awards\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association APRA honouring composers and songwriters.

The Capallero family later moved to the suburbs and Ving attended St. Lukes Elementary School in Glenside as well as St. John of the Cross in Roslyn before graduating from Abington Senior High SchoolVings mother taught him to play the mandolin at four years of age. He began studying guitar at age eleven and later studied with musicians Jim Hall and John Abercrombie.  He also studied with Ted Greene after moving to Los Angeles. As a teen he listened to blues records and particularly enjoyed their striking guitar sounds.  He was also interested in Jimi Hendrix the Rolling Stones as well as the experimental New York rock group The Fugs. He joined his first band while still in high schoolIn 1966 Ving enlisted in the army and served stateside during the Vietnam War.\n\nMusic career\nAfter leaving the army Ving became involved in Philadelphias folk blues and RB music scenes while studying Sociology at Villanova University. He joined the electric blues band Sweet Stavin Chain SSC as a vocalist and harmonica player. SSC frequently collaborated with jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker. The band also opened for The Who at the Electric Factory in 1968 and also opened for Cream at the Spectrum during Creams farewell tour later that same year. After leaving SSC Ving moved to New York and studied voice and guitar. In the mid1970s he moved to Los Angeles playing briefly with heavy metal bands before forming the hardcore punk band Fear. The bands first concert was in 1978Ving is Fears lead vocalist rhythm guitarist and harmonica player and is the only member to have remained with the band since its inception. During Fears performances at the LA. punk scene Ving was known for baiting his audience with insults earning him the nickname the Don Rickles of rock. Vings vocals have been described as bluesy evoking Howlin Wolf and Muddy Waters while also having a commanding drillsergeant vocal delivery and surly attitude helped to build a new breed of badtempered hardcore and a veinbusting rage that lends Ving the air of a loco Marine on a rampage.1981 marked an important year for Ving and Fear. The band was featured in the documentary The Decline of Western Civilization about Los Angeless punk scene. Ving was initially approached by the films director Penelope Spheeris while he was posting concert promo flyers to telephone poles in Los Angeles. Spheeris also introduced Fear to her husband Bob Biggs the founder and then president of Slash Records who signed the group to his label Fear released their debut album The Record with the label in 1982Fear also appeared on the 1981 Halloween episode of Saturday Night Live SNL at the suggestion of SNL writer Michael ODonoghue and then exSNL castmember John Belushi. Belushi became a fan of Fear after seeing them perform in 1980 on the LAbased music television show New Wave Theatre ODonoghue had seen the band in The Decline of Western Civilization. Belushi had initially commissioned the band to record a song for his film Neighbors but the movie studio rejected the recording and it never made the soundtrack. As a favor to Fear Belushi and ODonoghue made a deal with then producer Dick Ebersol whereby Belushi would make a cameo appearance on the show upon condition that Fear be allowed to perform as the episodes musical guests. A large portion of the crowd were punk music fans and included members of the bands Minor Threat CroMags The Meatmen and Negative Approach who rushed the stage and were moshing. One of the slam dancers Ian MacKaye yelled New York Sucks! which was broadcast live. Dick Ebersol who was stage manager at the time decided to cut to tape once the obscenities could be heardFears performance was initially pulled from subsequent SNL reruns and recorded releases of the episode but has subsequently been released in an edited form. The New York Post had initially reported that attendees of the performance caused 200,000 worth of damage however both the Los Angeles Times and Billboard later reported that a program spokesperson confirmed the cost of damages was actually a 40 fine for labor penalties. Both The Decline of Western Civilization and the Halloween SNL performance were an integral part of the history of hardcore punk having exposed the music genre to a much wider audienceVings vocals and harmonica playing were featured on the track Got to Get Out of New York from saxophonist Tom Scotts 1983 album Target. Fear found it difficult to find clubs willing to let them perform after their SNL performance and the band stopped playing in 1987. That same year Ving formed a country band called Range War that toured California and Texas. Two years later Ving moved with his wife and son to AustinFear reformed briefly under the bands original lineup in 1993.  A couple of years later Ving fronted an Austinbased band called Lee Vings Army that later toured under the name Fear and included former Frank Zappa bassist Scott Thunes drummer Andrew Jaimez and guitarist Sean CruseVing was also the vocalist for the band MD45, which also featured Dave Mustaine of Megadeth. The band released their only album The Craving in 1996, however in 2004 the album was remastered and rereleased with Mustaines vocals replacing those of VingVing appeared in Dave Grohls 2013 documentary Sound City and is a member of the supergroup Teenage Time Killers that came about due to the film. In 2015 Fears recordings from the Belushi film Neighbors were recovered by Belushis widow and Fears music was remastered and remixed by Ving at Grohls 606 studios in Los Angeles. Ving released the music digitally that same year. In an interview with Rolling Stone about Sound City Grohl stated that Fears performance in The Decline of Western Civilization inspired him to become a musician and that performing with Ving 30 years later was a profound lifealtering moment.\n\nActing career\nVing credited as Lee James Jude and the other members of Fear appeared in the 1981 rotoscope animated film American Pop directed by Ralph BakshiIn 1983, Ving appeared in several film roles.

He appeared in Flashdance as the owner of a topless club who tries to convince Jennifer Beals character to work for him. He played the overthetop punk singer named Piggy in the rockandroll comedy Get CrazyA year later Ving played Greer the henchman of Willem Dafoes character in the neonoir rock musical film  Streets of Fire and also appeared as a criminal in a police lineup in an episode of the shortlived Threes Company spinoff Threes a CrowdIn 1985, he played Mr. Boddy in the film Clue based on the board game of the same name. While the film was unsuccessful in theaters on its first run it later became a cult classic and it is often the role for which Ving is now most recognized.\nIn 1987 Ving appeared in the Whos the Boss episode titled Walk on the Mild Side. Ving played Jake McGuire a motorcyclist bad boy who Angela dates while fulfilling a list of wild things she wanted to do while in high school.

His work included music writing drawings and film. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in historyBorn in Liverpool Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed the Quarrymen which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called the smart Beatle Lennon initially was the groups de facto leader a role he gradually seemed to cede to McCartney. Through his songwriting in the Beatles he embraced myriad musical influences initially writing and cowriting rock and poporiented hit songs in the bands early years then later incorporating experimental elements into his compositions in the latter half of the Beatles career as his songs became known for their increasing innovation. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films including How I Won the War and authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with All You Need Is Love his songs were adopted as anthems by the antiwar movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife multimedia artist Yoko Ono held the twoweeklong antiwar demonstration Bedins for Peace and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works including a trilogy of avantgarde albums several more films his solo debut John LennonPlastic Ono Band and the international top10 singles Give Peace a Chance Instant Karma! Imagine and Happy Xmas War Is Over. Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a threeyear deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced Harry Nilssons album Pussy Cats. He also had charttopping collaborations with Elton John Whatever Gets You thru the Night and David Bowie Fame. Following a fiveyear hiatus Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was murdered by a Beatles fan Mark David Chapman three weeks after the albums release.\nAs a performer writer or cowriter Lennon had 25 numberone singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Double Fantasy his secondbestselling nonBeatles album won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. That year he won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifthgreatest singer and 38th greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\n\nEarly years 1940\u20131956\nJohn Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia n\u00e9e Stanley 1914\u20131958) and Alfred Lennon 1912\u20131976). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his sons birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather John Jack Lennon and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road Liverpool where Lennon lived with his mother the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later he offered to look after the family but Julia by then pregnant with another mans child rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpools Social Services twice Julia gave her custody of Lennon.\nIn July 1946, Lennons father visited her and took his son to Blackpool secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them  with her partner at the time Bobby Dykins  and after a heated argument his father forced the fiveyearold to choose between them. In one account of this incident Lennon twice chose his father but as his mother walked away he began to cry and followed her. According to author Mark Lewisohn however Lennons parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. Billy Hall who witnessed the incident has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate. Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 yearsThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence Lennon lived at Mendips 251 Menlove Avenue Woolton with Mimi and her husband George Toogood Smith who had no children of their own. His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him and his uncle a dairyman at his familys farm bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving crossword puzzles. Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis and John often visited her at 1 Blomfield Road Liverpool where she played him Elvis Presley records taught him the banjo and showed him how to play Aint That a Shame by Fats Domino. In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature\n\nA part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic poetmusician. But I cannot be what I am not ... I was the one who all the other boys parents  including Pauls father  would say Keep away from him ... The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker meaning I did not conform and I would influence their children which I did. I did my best to disrupt every friends home ... Partly out of envy that I didnt have this socalled home ... but I did ... There were five women that were my family. Five strong intelligent beautiful women five sisters. One happened to be my mother. She just couldnt deal with life. She was the youngest and she had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldnt cope with me and I ended up living with her elder sister. Now those women were fantastic ... And that was my first feminist education ... I would infiltrate the other boys minds. I could say Parents are not gods because I dont live with mine and therefore I know.\nHe regularly visited his cousin Stanley Parkes who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas. During the school holidays Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey another cousin and the three often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine Arthur Askey Max Bygraves and Joe Loss with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby. After Parkess family moved to Scotland the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled John cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16. Lennons uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955, aged 52Lennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School. After passing his elevenplus exam he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Harvey at the time as a happygolucky goodhumoured easy going lively lad. However he was also known to frequently engage in fights bully and disrupt classes. Despite this he quickly built a reputation as the class clown and often drew comical cartoons that appeared in his selfmade school magazine the Daily HowlIn 1956, Julia bought John his first guitar. The instrument was an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimis knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her sons musical aspirations. Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day and she hoped that he would grow bored with music often telling him The guitars all very well John but youll never make a living out of it.Lennons senior school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour. Teachers at Quarry Bank High School described him thus He has too many wrong ambitions and his energy is often misplaced and His work always lacks effort. He is content to drift instead of using his abilities. Lennons misbehaviour created a rift in his relationship with his aunt.\nOn 15 July 1958, at the age of 44, Julia Lennon was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths house. His mothers death traumatised the teenage Lennon who for the next two years drank heavily and frequently got into fights consumed by a blind rage. Julias memory would later serve as a major creative inspiration for Lennon inspiring songs such as the 1968 Beatles song Julia.Lennon failed his Olevel examinations and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art after his aunt and headmaster intervened. At the college he began to wear Teddy Boy clothes and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour. In the description of Cynthia Powell Lennons fellow student and subsequently his wife he was thrown out of the college before his final year.\n\nThe Quarrymen to the Beatles 1956\u20131970\nFormation fame and touring 1956\u20131966\nAt the age of 15, Lennon formed a skiffle group the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School the group was established by Lennon in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a spirited set of songs made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll. Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymens second performance which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St Peters Church garden f\u00eate. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the bandMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi was very aware that Johns friends were lower class and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon. According to McCartneys brother Mike their father similarly disapproved of Lennon declaring that Lennon would get his son into trouble. McCartneys father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the familys front room at 20 Forthlin Road. During this time Lennon wrote his first song Hello Little Girl which became a UK top 10 hit for the Fourmost in 1963McCartney recommended that his friend George Harrison become the lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison then 14 years old was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus where Harrison played Raunchy for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe Lennons friend from art school later joined as bassist. Lennon McCartney Harrison and Sutcliffe became The Beatles in early 1960. In August that year the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg in West Germany and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennons aunt horrified when he told her about the trip pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long overnight performances.\nBrian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists but he had a strong influence on the groups dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance but eventually complied saying Ill wear a bloody balloon if somebodys going to pay me. McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr this completed the fourpiece lineup that would remain until the groups breakup in 1970. The bands first single Love Me Do was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album Please Please Me in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day Twist and Shout. The LennonMcCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions one being the album title itself Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics saying We were just writing songs ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that  to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant. In a 1987 interview McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon He was like our own little Elvis ... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\nThe Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son Julian was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty Lennon poked fun at the audience For our next song Id like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands ... and the rest of you if youll just rattle your jewellery. After a year of Beatlemania in the UK the groups historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A twoyear period of constant touring filmmaking and songwriting followed during which Lennon wrote two books In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire MBE in the 1965 Queens Birthday HonoursLennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans and that the bands musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennons Help! expressed his own feelings in 1965: I meant it ... It was me singing help. He had put on weight he would later refer to this as his Fat Elvis period and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he and Harrison were unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives spiked the guests coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave their host revealed what they had taken and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later in a lift at a nightclub they all believed it was on fire Lennon recalled We were all screaming ... hot and hysterical. In March 1966, during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave Lennon remarked Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink ... Were more popular than Jesus now  I dont know which will go first rock and roll or Christianity. The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed which included the burning of Beatles records Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon contributed to the bands decision to stop touring.\n\nStudio years breakup and solo work 1966\u20131970\nAfter the bands final concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon filmed the antiwar black comedy How I Won the War  his only appearance in a nonBeatles feature film  before rejoining his bandmates for an extended period of recording beginning in November. Lennon had increased his use of LSD and according to author Ian MacDonald his continuous use of the drug in 1967 brought him close to erasing his identity. The year 1967 saw the release of Strawberry Fields Forever hailed by Time magazine for its astonishing inventiveness and the groups landmark album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band which revealed lyrics by Lennon that contrasted strongly with the simple love songs of the groups early yearsIn late June the Beatles performed Lennons All You Need Is Love as Britains contribution to the Our World satellite broadcast before an international audience estimated at up to 400 million. Intentionally simplistic in its message the song formalised his pacifist stance and provided an anthem for the Summer of Love. After the Beatles were introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the group attended an August weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor Wales. During the seminar they were informed of Epsteins death. I knew we were in trouble then Lennon said later. I didnt have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music. I was scared  I thought Weve fucking had it now. McCartney organised the groups first postEpstein project the selfwritten produced and directed television film Magical Mystery Tour which was released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop its soundtrack release featuring Lennons Lewis Carrollinspired I Am the Walrus was a successLed by Harrison and Lennons interest the Beatles travelled to the Maharishis ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance. While there they composed most of the songs for their double album The Beatles but the band members mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the groups camaraderie. On their return to London they became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve artistic freedom within a business structure. Released amid the Protests of 1968, the bands debut single for the Apple label included Lennons Bside Revolution in which he called for a plan rather than committing to Maoist revolution. The songs pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press. Adding to the tensions at the Beatles recording sessions that year Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend the Japanese artist Yoko Ono beside him thereby contravening the bands policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to Sgt. Pepper. At the end of 1968, Lennon participated in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus a television special that was not broadcast. Lennon performed with the Dirty Mac a supergroup composed of Lennon Eric Clapton Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell. The group also backed a vocal performance by Ono. A film version was released in 1996.\nBy late 1968, Lennons increased drug use and growing preoccupation with Ono combined with the Beatles inability to agree on how the company should be run left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role but he declined advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by Allen Klein who had managed the Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apples chief executive by Lennon Harrison and Starr but McCartney never signed the management contractLennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969 and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called Bag One depicting scenes from their honeymoon eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. Lennons creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins known more for its cover than for its music Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions and Wedding Album. In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969. Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles Give Peace a Chance which was widely adopted as an antiVietnam War anthem Cold Turkey which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin and Instant Karma!.\n\nIn protest at Britains involvement in the NigeriaBiafra thing namely the Nigerian Civil War its support of America in the Vietnam War and perhaps jokingly against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen. This gesture had no effect on his MBE status which could be renounced but ultimately only the Sovereign has the power to annul the original award. The medal together with Lennons letter is held at the Central Chancery of the Orders of KnighthoodLennon left the Beatles on 20 September 1969, but agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract. He was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennons reaction was Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it! He later wrote I started the band. I disbanded it. Its as simple as that. In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney saying I was a fool not to do what Paul did which was use it to sell a record. Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono and of how he Harrison and Starr got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?\n\nSolo career 1970\u20131980\nInitial solo success and activism 1970\u20131972\nBetween 1 April and 15 September 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov at Tittenhurst in London and at Janovs clinic in Los Angeles California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood the therapy entailed two halfdays a week with Janov for six months he had wanted to treat the couple for longer but their American visa ran out and they had to return to the UK. Lennons debut solo album John LennonPlastic Ono Band 1970) was received with praise by many music critics but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. The album featured the song Mother in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection and the Dylanesque Working Class Hero a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which due to the lyric youre still fucking peasants fell foul of broadcastersIn January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon who immediately responded by writing Power to the People. In his lyrics to the song Lennon reversed the nonconfrontational approach he had espoused in Revolution although he later disowned Power to the People saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as disgusting fascism and he and Ono as Elastic Oz Band released the single God Save UsDo the Oz and joined marches in support of the magazine.\n\nEager for a major commercial success Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album Imagine 1971). Rolling Stone reported that it contains a substantial portion of good music but warned of the possibility that his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant. The albums title track later became an anthem for antiwar movements while the song How Do You Sleep? was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on Ram that Lennon felt and McCartney later confirmed were directed at him and Ono. In Jealous Guy Lennon addressed his demeaning treatment of women acknowledging that his past behaviour was the result of longheld insecurityIn gratitude for his guitar contributions to Imagine Lennon initially agreed to perform at Harrisons Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York. Harrison refused to allow Ono to participate at the concerts however which resulted in the couple having a heated argument and Lennon pulling out of the eventLennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their Happy Xmas War Is Over single in December. During the new year the Nixon administration took what it called a strategic countermeasure against Lennons antiwar and antiNixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a fouryear attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities and he was denied permanent residency in the US the issue would not be resolved until 1976Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephants Memory. A double LP it contained songs about womens rights race relations Britains role in Northern Ireland and Lennons difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics who found its political sloganeering heavyhanded and relentless. The NMEs review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a pathetic ageing revolutionary. In the US Woman Is the Nigger of the World was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word nigger.Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephants Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last fulllength concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon Lennon and Ono attended a postelection wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Onos song Death of Samantha was inspired by the incident.\n\nLost weekend 1973\u20131975\nAs Lennon was about to record Mind Games in 1973, he and Ono decided to separate. The ensuing 18-month period apart which he later called his lost weekend in reference to the film of the same name was spent in Los Angeles and New York City in the company of May Pang. Mind Games credited to the Plastic UFOno Band was released in November 1973. Lennon also contributed Im the Greatest to Starrs album Ringo 1973) released the same month. With Harrison joining Starr and Lennon at the recording session for the song it marked the only occasion when three former Beatles recorded together between the bands breakup and Lennons deathIn early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcoholfuelled antics with Harry Nilsson made headlines. In March two widely publicised incidents occurred at The Troubadour club. In the first incident Lennon stuck an unused menstrual pad on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress. The second incident occurred two weeks later when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon decided to produce Nilssons album Pussy Cats and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians. After a month of further debauchery the recording sessions were in chaos and Lennon returned to New York with Pang to finish work on the album. In April Lennon had produced the Mick Jagger song Too Many Cooks Spoil the Soup which was for contractual reasons to remain unreleased for more than 30 years. Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on The Very Best of Mick Jagger 2007).Lennon had settled back in New York when he recorded the album Walls and Bridges. Released in October 1974, it included Whatever Gets You thru the Night which featured Elton John on backing vocals and piano and became Lennons only single as a solo artist to top the US Billboard Hot 100 chart during his lifetime. A second single from the album 9 Dream followed before the end of the year. Starrs Goodnight Vienna 1974) again saw assistance from Lennon who wrote the title track and played piano. On 28 November Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton Johns Thanksgiving concert at Madison Square Garden in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if Whatever Gets You thru the Night a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted reached number one. Lennon performed the song along with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and I Saw Her Standing There which he introduced as a song by an old estranged fianc\u00e9 of mine called Paul.In the first two weeks of January 1975, Elton John topped the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with his cover of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds featuring Lennon on guitar and backing vocals  Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of Dr. Winston OBoogie. As January became February Lennon and Ono reunited as Lennon and Bowie completed recording of their cocomposition Fame which became David Bowies first US number one featuring guitar and backing vocals by Lennon. In February Lennon released Rock n Roll 1975) an album of cover songs. Stand by Me taken from the album and a US and UK hit became his last single for five years. He made what would be his final stage appearance in the ATV special A Salute to Lew Grade recorded on 18 April and televised in June. Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eightpiece band Lennon performed two songs from Rock n Roll Stand by Me which was not broadcast and Slippin and Slidin followed by Imagine. The band known as Etc wore masks behind their heads a dig by Lennon who thought Grade was twofaced.\n\nHiatus and return 1975\u20131980\nSean was Lennons only child with Ono. Sean was born on 9 October 1975 Lennons thirtyfifth birthday and John took on the role of househusband. Lennon began what would be a fiveyear hiatus from the music industry during which time he later said he baked bread and looked after the baby. He devoted himself to Sean rising at 6 am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote Cookin In the Kitchen of Love for Starrs Ringos Rotogravure 1976) performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying we have basically decided without any great decision to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family. During his career break he created several series of drawings and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed mad stuff all of which would be published posthumously.\nLennon emerged from his hiatus in October 1980, when he released the single Just Like Starting Over. In November he and Ono released the album Double Fantasy which included songs Lennon had written in Bermuda. In June Lennon chartered a 43-foot sailboat and embarked on a sailing trip to Bermuda. En route he and the crew encountered a storm rendering everyone on board seasick except Lennon who took control and sailed the boat through the storm. This experience reinvigorated him and his creative muse. He spent three weeks in Bermuda in a home called Fairylands writing and refining the tracks for the upcoming albumThe music reflected Lennons fulfilment in his newfound stable family life. Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned followup album Milk and Honey which was issued posthumously in 1984. Double Fantasy was not well received initially and drew comments such as Melody Makers indulgent sterility ... a godawful yawn.\n\nMurder 8 December 1980\nIn New York at approximately 5:00 pm. on 8 December 1980, Lennon autographed a copy of Double Fantasy for Mark David Chapman before leaving The Dakota with Ono for a recording session at the Record Plant. After the session Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine at around 10:50 pm. EST. They left the vehicle and walked through the archway of the building. Chapman then shot Lennon twice in the back and twice in the shoulder at close range. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to the emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:15 pm. EST.Ono issued a statement the next day saying There is no funeral for John ending it with the words John loved and prayed for the human race. Please do the same for him. His remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale New York. Ono scattered his ashes in New Yorks Central Park where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created. Chapman avoided going to trial when he ignored his lawyers advice and pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder and was sentenced to 20-yearstolifeIn the weeks following the murder Just Like Starting Over and Double Fantasy topped the charts in the UK and the US. Imagine hit number one in the UK in January 1981 and Happy Xmas peaked at number two. Imagine was succeeded at the top of the UK chart by Woman the second single from Double Fantasy. Later that year Roxy Musics cover version of Jealous Guy recorded as a tribute to Lennon was also a UK numberone.\n\nPersonal relationships\nCynthia Lennon\nLennon met Cynthia Powell 1939\u20132015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennons attitude and appearance she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out but when she said that she was engaged he shouted I didnt ask you to fuckin marry me did I? She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartneys girlfriend to visit himLennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive often terrifying Powell with his anger. In her 2005 memoir John Powell recalled that when they were dating Lennon once struck her after he observed her dancing with Stuart Sutcliffe. She ended their relationship as a result until three months later when Lennon apologised and asked to reunite. She took him back and later noted that he was never again physically abusive towards her although he could still be verbally cutting and unkind. Lennon later said that until he met Ono he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude towards women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his or his peers own story. I used to be cruel to my woman and physically  any woman. I was a hitter. I couldnt express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant Lennon said Theres only one thing for it Cyn. Well have to get married. The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days laterCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennons use of LSD and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogis Transcendental Meditation seminar a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After spending a holiday in Greece Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood to find Lennon sitting on the floor with Ono in terrycloth robes and left the house to stay with friends feeling shocked and humiliated. A few weeks later Alexis Mardas informed Powell that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian. She received a letter stating that Lennon was doing so on the grounds of her adultery with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini an accusation which Powell denied. After negotiations Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her 100,000, a small annual payment and custody of Julian.\n\nBrian Epstein\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpools Cavern Club in November 1961 when they were introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual and closeted and according to biographer Philip Norman one of Epsteins reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it Lennon said Well it was almost a love affair but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and Id say Do you like that one? Do you like this one? I was rather enjoying the experience thinking like a writer all the time I am experiencing this. Soon after their return from Spain at McCartneys twentyfirst birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying How was your honeymoon John? The MC known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks was making a joke but ten months had passed since Lennons marriage and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in.Lennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish. When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography Lennon offered Queer Jew on learning of the eventual title A Cellarful of Noise he parodied More like A Cellarful of Boys. He demanded of a visitor to Epsteins flat Have you come to blackmail him? If not youre the only bugger in London who hasnt. During the recording of Baby Youre a Rich Man he sang altered choruses of Baby youre a rich fag Jew.\n\nJulian Lennon\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia Lennons first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julians birth like his mother Cynthias marriage to Lennon was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said Whats this? I said Its Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD Lennon insisted Its not an acid song. Lennon was distant from Julian who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennons divorce McCartney composed a song Hey Jules to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song Hey Jude. Lennon later said Thats his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian  ... he turned it into Hey Jude. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasnt.Lennons relationship with Julian was already strained and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pangs encouragement arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father got on a great deal better during the time he spent in New York We had a lot of fun laughed a lot and had a great time in general.In a Playboy interview with David Sheff shortly before his death Lennon said Sean is a planned child and therein lies the difference. I dont love Julian any less as a child. Hes still my son whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didnt have pills in those days. Hes here he belongs to me and he always will. He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-yearold and confidently predicted Julian and I will have a relationship in the future. After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.\n\nYoko Ono\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Onos Hammer A Nail patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her Dont you know who this is? Hes a millionaire! He might buy it. According to Lennons recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings to which Lennon said he replied Ill give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in. Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple much to her furyOno began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her avantgarde bullshit. While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album after which he said they made love at dawn. When Lennons wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said Oh hi. Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennons divorce from Cynthia was grantedTwo years before the Beatles disbanded Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam campaigning with a weeklong BedIn for Peace. They planned another BedIn in the United States but were denied entry so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal where they recorded Give Peace a Chance. They often combined advocacy with performance art as in their Bagism first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song The Ballad of John and Yoko. Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding Ono as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter some official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire. After Ono was injured in a car accident Lennon arranged for a kingsize bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles album Abbey RoadOno and Lennon moved to New York to a flat on Bank Street Greenwich Village. Looking for somewhere with better security they relocated in 1973 to the more secure Dakota overlooking Central Park at 1 West 72nd Street.\n\nMay Pang\nABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon telling her He likes you a lot. Astounded by Onos proposition Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennons companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles beginning an 18-month period he later called his lost weekend. In Los Angeles Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr McCartney Beatles roadie Mal Evans and Harry Nilsson.\nIn June Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December he and Pang were considering a house purchase and he refused to accept Onos telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.\n\nSean Lennon\nOno had previously suffered three miscarriages in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on the condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband which he agreed to doFollowing Seans birth Lennons subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him which were posthumously published as Real Love The Drawings for Sean. Lennon later proudly declared He didnt come out of my belly but by God I made his bones because Ive attended to every meal and to how he sleeps and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\n\nFormer Beatles\nWhile Lennon remained consistently friendly with Starr during the years that followed the Beatles breakup in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour Lennon agreed to join him on stage but failed to appear after an argument over Lennons refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published I Me Mine an autobiography that Lennon felt made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every twobit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. Im not in the book.Lennons most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of How Do You Sleep? Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartneys final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. According to Lennon the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance attempting to claim their share of the money but they were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death Throughout my career Ive selected to work with ... only two people Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ... That aint bad picking.Along with his estrangement from McCartney Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death according to Fred Seaman Lennon and Onos assistant at the time Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released Coming Up in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. Its driving me crackers! he jokingly complained because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends and he replied that they were neither and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said I still love those guys. The Beatles are over but John Paul George and Ringo go on.\n\nPolitical activism\nLennon and Ono used their honeymoon as a BedIn for Peace at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule. During a second BedIn three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal Lennon wrote and recorded Give Peace a Chance. Released as a single the song was quickly interpreted as an antiwar anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the Vietnam War in Washington DC on 15 November the second Vietnam Moratorium Day. In December they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared in the national language War Is Over! If You Want It.During the year Lennon and Ono began to support efforts by the family of James Hanratty to prove his innocence. Hanratty had been hanged in 1962. According to Lennon those who had condemned Hanratty were the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets ... The same bastards are in control the same people are running everything its the whole bullshit bourgeois scene. In London Lennon and Ono staged a Britain Murdered Hanratty banner march and a Silent Protest For James Hanratty and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an appeal hearing more than thirty years later Hanrattys conviction was upheld after DNA evidence was found to match validating those who condemned him.\nLennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the Clydeside UCS workers workin of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for 5,000. On moving to New York City in August that year they befriended two of the Chicago Seven Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Another political activist John Sinclair poet and cofounder of the White Panther Party was serving ten years in prison for selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug. In December 1971 at Ann Arbor Michigan 15,000 people attended the John Sinclair Freedom Rally a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon Stevie Wonder Bob Seger Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party and others. Lennon and Ono backed by David Peel and Jerry Rubin performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming Some Time in New York City album including John Sinclair whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond. The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on John Lennon Anthology 1998).Following the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, Lennon said that given the choice between the British army and the IRA he would side with the latter. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their Some Time in New York City album The Luck of the Irish and Sunday Bloody Sunday. In 2000, David Shayler a former member of Britains domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA though this was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film The Irish Tapes a political documentary with an Irish Republican slant. In February 2000 Lennons cousin Stanley Parkes stated that the singer had given money to the IRA during the 1970s. After the events of Bloody Sunday Lennon and Ono attended a protest in London while displaying a Red Mole newspaper with the headline For the IRA Against British Imperialism.\n\nAccording to FBI surveillance reports and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006, Lennon was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group a Trotskyist group formed in Britain in 1968. However the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary as he was constantly under the influence of narcotics.In 1972, Lennon contributed a drawing and limerick titled Why Make It Sad to Be Gay? to Len Richmond and Gary Nogueras The Gay Liberation Book. Lennons last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers protest on 14 December.\n\nDeportation attempt\nFollowing the impact of Give Peace a Chance and Happy Xmas War Is Over on the antiwar movement the Nixon administration heard rumours of Lennons involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the Republican National Convention and tried to have him deported. Nixon believed that Lennons antiwar activities could cost him his reelection Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that deportation would be a strategic countermeasure against Lennon. The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service INS began deportation proceedings arguing that his 1968 misdemeanour conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States. Lennon spent the next 3+1\u20442 years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt stating the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds. While the legal battle continued Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances. He and Ono cohosted The Mike Douglas Show for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to midAmerica. In 1972, Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon stating\n\nJohn and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the countrys socalled art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so only help others to see pure light and in doing that put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The countrys got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\nOn 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days. Ono meanwhile was granted permanent residence. In response Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia a place with no land no boundaries no passports only people. Waving the white flag of Nutopia two handkerchiefs they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed and appeared in a 2006 documentary The US. vs. John Lennon. Soon after the press conference Nixons involvement in a political scandal came to light and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington DC. They led to the presidents resignation 14 months later. In December 1974, when he and members of his tour entourage visited the White House Harrison asked Gerald Ford Nixons successor to intercede in the matter. Fords administration showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year Lennon received his green card certifying his permanent residency and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.\n\nFBI surveillance and declassified documents\nAfter Lennons death historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files that documented the Bureaus role in the deportation attempt. The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages. The ACLU representing Wiener won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case. In 1997, respecting President Bill Clintons newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve foreseeable harm the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documentsWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. Gimme Some Truth The John Lennon FBI Files contained facsimiles of the documents including lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of antiwar activists memos to the White House transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges. The story is told in the documentary The US vs. John Lennon. The final 10 documents in Lennons FBI file which reported on his ties with London antiwar activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a leftwing bookshop and reading room.\n\nWriting\nBeatles biographer Bill Harry wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories poetry cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people and the writings satirical and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up and in Lennons story A Carrot in a Potato Mine the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier. Turner described how one of Lennons cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question Why? Above was a flying pancake and below a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog  also wearing glasses.Lennons love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write 1964) was published after Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said Write a book and thats how the first one came about. Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories poetry plays and drawings. One story Good Dog Nigel tells the tale of a happy dog urinating on a lamp post barking wagging his tail  until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three oclock. The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories remarkable ... also very funny ... the nonsense runs on words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy. Book Week reported This is nonsense writing but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play many others have not only double meaning but a double edge. Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception but that the book was reviewed at all and suggested that readers took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me.In combination with A Spaniard in the Works 1965) In His Own Write formed the basis of the stage play The Lennon Play In His Own Write coadapted by Victor Spinetti and Adrienne Kennedy. After negotiations between Lennon Spinetti and the artistic director of the National Theatre Sir Laurence Olivier the play opened at The Old Vic in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance their second public appearance together. In 1969, Lennon wrote Four in Hand a skit based on his teenage experiences of group masturbation for Kenneth Tynans play Oh! Calcutta! After Lennons death further works were published including Skywriting by Word of Mouth 1986) Ai Japan Through John Lennons Eyes A Personal Sketchbook 1992) with Lennons illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words and Real Love The Drawings for Sean 1999). The Beatles Anthology 2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\n\nArt\nIn 1967, Lennon who had attended art school funded and anonymously participated in Onos art exhibition HalfARoom that was held at Lisson Gallery. Following his collaborating with Ono in the form of The Plastic Ono Band that began in 1968, Lennon became involved with the Fluxus art movement. In the summer of 1968, Lennon began showing his painting and conceptual art at his You Are Here art exhibition held at Robert Fraser Gallery in London. The show that was dedicated to Ono included a six foot in diameter round white monochrome painting called You Are Here 1968). Besides the white monochrome paint its surface contained only the tiny hand written inscription you are here. This painting and the show in general was conceived as a response to Onos conceptual art piece This is Not Here 1966) that was part of her Fluxus installation of wall text pieces called Blue Room Event 1966). Blue Room Event consisted of sentences that Ono wrote directly on her white New York apartment walls and ceiling. Lennons You Are Here show also included sixty charity collection boxes a pair of Lennons shoes with a sign that read I take my shoes off to you a ready made black bike an apparent homage to Marcel Duchamp and his 1917 Bicycle Wheel an overturned white hat labeled For The Artist and a large glass jar full of freetotake you are here white pin badges. A hidden camera secretly filmed the public reaction to the show. For the 1 July opening Lennon dressed all in white as was Ono released 365 white balloons into the city sky. Each ballon had attached to it a small paper card to be mailed back to Lennon at the Robert Fraser Gallery at 69 Duke Street with the finders commentsAfter moving to New York City from 18 April to 12 June 1970, Lennon and Ono presented a series of Fluxus conceptual art events and concerts at Joe Joness Tone Deaf Music Store called GRAPEFRUIT FLUXBANQUET. Performances included Come Impersonating John Lennon  Yoko Ono Grapefruit Banquet and Portrait of John Lennon as a Young Cloud by Yoko  Everybody. That same year Lennon also made The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game 1970) a conceptual art poem collage that utilized the cutup or d\u00e9coup\u00e9 aleatory technique typical of the work of John Cage and many Fluxus artists. The cutup technique can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s but was popularized in the early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs. For The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game Lennon took the portrait photo of himself that was included in the packaging of the 1968 The Beatles LP aka The White Album and cut it into 134 small rectangles. A single word was written on the back of each fragment to be read in any order. The portrait image was meant to be reassembled in any order. The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game was presented by Lennon to Ono on 28 July in an inscribed envelope for her to randomly assemble and reassemble at willLennon made whimsical drawings and fine art prints on occasion until the end of his life. For example Lennon exhibited at Eugene Schusters London Arts Gallery his Bag One lithographs in an exhibition that included several depicting erotic imagery. The show opened on 15 January 1970 and 24 hours later it was raided by police officers who confiscated 8 of the 14 lithos on the grounds of indecency. The lithographs had been drawn by Lennon in 1969 chronicling his wedding and honeymoon with Yoko Ono and one of their bedins staged in the interests of world peaceIn 1969, Lennon appeared in the Yoko Ono Fluxus art film SelfPortrait which consisted of a single fortyminute shot of Lennons penis. The film was premiered at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In 1971, Lennon made an experimental art film called Erection that was edited on 16 mm film by George Maciunas founder of the Fluxus art movement and avantgarde contemporary of Ono. The film uses the songs Airmale and You from Onos 1971 album Fly as its soundtrack.\n\nMusicianship\nInstruments played\nLennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland the music caught the drivers ear. Impressed the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger had left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennons toy. He would continue to play the harmonica often using the instrument during the Beatles Hamburg years and it became a signature sound in the groups early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the QuarrymenAs his career progressed he played a variety of electric guitars predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J160E and from the start of his solo career the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his Dstring slightly flat so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a sixstring bass guitar the Fender Bass VI providing bass on some Beatles numbers Back in the USSR. The Long and Winding Road Helter Skelter that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano on which he composed many songs including Imagine described as his bestknown solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles first US number one I Want to Hold Your Hand. In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until Strawberry Fields Forever in 1967.\n\nVocal style\nThe British critic Nik Cohn observed of Lennon He owned one of the best pop voices ever rasped and smashed and brooding always fierce. Cohn wrote that Lennon performing Twist and Shout would rant his way into total incoherence half rupture himself. When the Beatles recorded the song the final track during the mammoth oneday session that produced the bands 1963 debut album Please Please Me Lennons voice already compromised by a cold came close to giving out. Lennon said I couldnt sing the damn thing I was just screaming. In the words of biographer Barry Miles Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock n roll. The Beatles producer George Martin tells how Lennon had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me DO something with my voice!  ... put something on it ... Make it different. Martin obliged often using doubletracking and other techniquesAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acousticled confessional ballads so beginning the process of public therapy that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of Cold Turkey and the cathartic John LennonPlastic Ono Band. Music critic Robert Christgau called this Lennons greatest vocal performance ... from scream to whine is modulated electronically ... echoed filtered and double tracked. David Stuart Ryan described Lennons vocal delivery as ranging from extreme vulnerability sensitivity and even naivety to a hard rasping style. Wiener too described contrasts saying the singers voice can be at first subdued soon it almost cracks with despair. Music historian Ben Urish recalled hearing the Beatles Ed Sullivan Show performance of This Boy played on the radio a few days after Lennons murder As Lennons vocals reached their peak ... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had.\n\nLegacy\nMusic historians Schinder and Schwartz wrote of the transformation in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s. They said that the Beatles influence cannot be overstated having revolutionised the sound style and attitude of popular music and opened rock and rolls doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts the group then spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rocks stylistic frontiers. On National Poetry Day in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UKs favourite song lyric and announced Imagine as the winnerTwo home recording demos by Lennon Free as a Bird and Real Love were finished by the three surviving members of the Beatles when they reunited in 1994 and 1995. Both songs were released as Beatles singles in conjunction with The Beatles Anthology compilations. A third song Now and Then was also worked on but not released until 2023 whereupon it was dubbed the last Beatles song topping the UK chartsIn 1997, Yoko Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition programme for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honour John Lennons memory and his large creative legacy. Over 400,000 have been given through BMI Foundations John Lennon Scholarships to talented young musicians in the United StatesIn a 2006 Guardian article Jon Wiener wrote For young people in 1972, it was thrilling to see Lennons courage in standing up to US President Nixon. That willingness to take risks with his career and his life is one reason why people still admire him today. For music historians Urish and Bielen Lennons most significant effort was the selfportraits ... in his songs which spoke to for and about the human condition.In 2013, Downtown Music Publishing signed a publishing administration agreement for the US with Lenono Music and Ono Music home to the song catalogues of John Lennon and Yoko Ono respectively. Under the terms of the agreement Downtown represents Lennons solo works including Imagine Instant Karma We All Shine On Power to the People Happy Xmas War Is Over Jealous Guy Just Like Starting Over and others.\nLennon has been the subject of numerous memorials and tributes. In 2002, the airport in Lennons home town was renamed the Liverpool John Lennon Airport. On what would have been Lennons 70th birthday in 2010, Cynthia and Julian Lennon unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in Chavasse Park Liverpool. The sculpture entitled Peace  Harmony exhibits peace symbols and carries the inscription Peace on Earth for the Conservation of Life  In Honour of John Lennon 1940\u20131980\". In December 2013, the International Astronomical Union named one of the craters on Mercury after LennonThere is a John Lennon Park in Havana Cuba which features a statue in his likeness sitting on a bench.\n\nAccolades\nThe LennonMcCartney songwriting partnership is regarded as one of the most influential and successful of the 20th century. As performer writer or cowriter Lennon had 25 number one singles in the US Hot 100 chart. His album sales in the US stand at 14 million units. Double Fantasy was his bestselling album at three million shipments in the US. Released shortly before his death it won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. That year the BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music was given to LennonParticipants in a 2002 BBC poll voted him eighth of 100 Greatest Britons. Between 2003 and 2008, Rolling Stone recognised Lennon in several reviews of artists and music ranking him fifth of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time and 38th of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and his albums John LennonPlastic Ono Band and Imagine 22nd and 76th respectively of Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire MBE with the other Beatles in 1965, but returned his medal in 1969 because of Britains involvement in the NigeriaBiafra thing against our support of America in Vietnam and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts. Lennon was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nJohn LennonPlastic Ono Band Apple 1970)\nImagine Apple 1971)\nSome Time in New York City with Yoko Ono Apple 1972)\nMind Games Apple 1973)\nWalls and Bridges Apple 1974)\nRock n Roll Apple 1975)\nDouble Fantasy with Yoko Ono Geffen 1980)\nMilk and Honey Posthumous with Yoko Ono Polydor 1984)\n\nExperimental studio albums with Yoko Ono\nUnfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins Apple 1968)\nUnfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions Zapple 1969)\nWedding Album Apple 1969)\n\nFilmography\nAll releases after his death in 1980 use archival footage.\n\nFilm\nTelevision\nBibliography\nIn His Own Write 1964)\nA Spaniard in the Works 1965)\nSkywriting by Word of Mouth 1986)\nLyrics of John Lennon 1997)\nThe John Lennon Letters 2012)\n\nSee also\nOutline of the Beatles\nThe Beatles timeline\nList of peace activists\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nJohn Lennon at AllMusic \nJohn Lennon in the Hollywood Walk of Fame Directory\nJohn Lennon.

Best known for writing solo classical guitar music he also composed an opera at the age of 19) three symphonies guitar duos piano music songs a Mass and at least two successful ballets Cinderella which received over one hundred performances and Hercule et Omphale.\nPartly because Sor was himself such a classical guitar virtuosocontemporaries considered him to be the best in the worldhe made a point of writing didactic music for players of that instrument of all levels. His Twelve Studies Op. 6, the Twelve Studies Op. 29, the 24) Progressive Lessons Op. 31, and the 24) Very Easy Exercises Op. 35 have been widely played for two hundred years and are regularly reprinted. On the other hand some of Sors music not least his popular Introduction and Variations on Mozarts Das klinget so herrlich Op. 9, is fiendishly difficult.\nUnlike modern classical guitar players Sor used the smaller slimmer Romantic guitars predating todays familiar Torres instrument. He used the ring finger of his plucking hand rarely and only for harmony never for melody. He eschewed the use of nails on that hand.\n\nVariance of name\nAs Sors works were published in various countries his name was translated leading to variances in its spelling. These included Joseph Fernando Macario Sors Ferdinand Sor Ferdinando Sor and in the last years Ferran Sor. His family name appears in various forms in other contemporary documents as well and there is not always a record of his having approved or used them. But in the file and marriage certificate of his grandfather which includes Fernandos greatgrandfathers the name always appears as Sor and this is true too of the corresponding document for one of the greatgrandfathers the oldest document yet found.\n\nBiography\nSpain\nBorn in Barcelona to a fairly welloff family he was baptized as Jos\u00e9 Fernando Macario Sors as recorded in the baptismal record although in most of his manuscript and printed musical works he appears as Fernando Sor or Ferdinand Sor and only in some cases does his surname appear as SorsSor was descended from a long line of career soldiers and intended to continue that legacy but was distracted from this when his father introduced him to Italian opera. He fell in love with music and abandoned his military ambitions. Along with opera Sors father also introduced him to the guitar.\n\n At a young age Sors parents wouldnt give his musical abilities too much special attention for fear it would distract from his Latin studies. Therefore the young Sor still not 11 years old began to write songs to words in Latin to impress his parents. He even invented his own system for notating music as he had not yet received formal training.\nWhen he reached the age of 11 or 12, the head of the Barcelona Cathedral took notice of young Sors talent and he was enrolled in the school there. Not long after his father died leaving his mother without the funds to continue his education at the Cathedral. However at around the same time Joseph Arredondo the new abbot of Santa Maria de Montserrat the famous monastery heard of his talent and provided funds for him to attend the choir school located at the monastery. Sor reveals in writings mainly from the last ten years of his life that he was greatly attached to this place and had fond nostalgic memories of his childhood there. But his mother began to see that Sor was becoming greatly distracted from his chosen path in the military or administration and following the advice of friends took him out of the monastery and placed him in military school for four years. It was not a terrible turn of events as he had much free time to play and compose music in the army as wellIn 1808, when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain Sor began to write nationalistic music for the guitar often accompanied by patriotic lyrics. Sor was even part of traveling military bands that would play protest music on the streets. He was also promoted to captain in C\u00f3rdoba and may have fought battles against the French at this time. After the defeat of the Spanish army however Sor accepted an administrative post in the occupying government. Here he was to be officially labeled an afrancesado along with the other Spaniards who abandoned their defense of Spain to embrace the French Revolutionary ideas. After the Spanish repelled the French in 1813, Sor and other afrancesados left Spain for fear of retribution. He went to Paris never to return to his home country again.\n\nParis London and Moscow\nHaving abandoned his familys ideal of a military or administrative post Sor could finally give music a serious try in France. He gained renown at first as a virtuoso guitarist and composer for the instrument. When he attempted composing operas however he was rejected by the French. His Op. 7 was a large and strange piece notated in three clefs and no guitarist at the time could play it.  Since France was no longer supportive of his music Sor decided to try his talents elsewhere.\nIn 1815, he went to London to attempt to build a stronger music career there. Again he gained considerable fame as a classical guitarist and gave guitar and voice lessons. Since ballet in London was more popular than opera Sor decided to try his hand at this new genre of music. He had considerable success this time especially with his ballet CendrillonBy 1823, once he had acquired a level of fame in London Sor again wandered away this time with his wife the ballerina F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Hullin to Moscow in her quest to become a prima ballerina. Not much is known about his time there however despite the exaggeration about his romantic and professional life. After three years in Moscow he traveled around Europe giving concerts and getting into music circles everywhere he wentIn 1827, partly due to his advancing age he settled down and decided to live out the rest of his life back in Paris. It was during this retirement that he composed the majority of his classical guitar works. He had to comply with the demands of the public though and most guitarists wanted technically simple nicesounding pieces. It was in these last ten or so years of his life that his writings reveal his bitterness towards how his publications were being received by the public. For example Op. 43 is entitled Mes Ennuis My Annoyances and six of his ballets are dedicated to whoever wants them. These and other caustic remarks did not help his sales in the least. The foreword to Op. 45 goes even further than sarcasm Lets see if thats that. Six short and easy pieces in stages which aim to lead to what has generally been agreed are difficulties. Composed and dedicated to the person with the least patience by Fernando Sor. Opus 45.His last work was a mass in honour of his daughter who died in 1837. The event sent the already sickly Sor into serious depression and he died in 1839, of tongue and throat cancer.\n\nQuotations\nFran\u00e7oisJoseph F\u00e9tis has called him le Beethoven de la guitare though he has also remarked that Sor had failed to produce a good tone on one occasion.\n\nThe creative worth of Sors guitar sonatas is high. The ideas which grow out of the instrument yet stand up well enough apart from it are fresh and distinctive. The harmony is skillful and surprisingly varied with bold key changes and with rich modulations in the development sections. The texture is naturally of interest too with the melody shifted from top to bottom to middle and frequent contrapuntal bits added. Among the extended forms the first Allegro movements still show considerable flexibility in the application of sonata form especially in the larger number of ideas introduced and recalled. For that matter the style still goes back to that of Joseph Haydn and Mozart especially in the first movement of Op. 22, which has all the neatness of syntax and accompaniment to be found in a classic symphony and its third and fourth movements which could nicely pass as a Minuet and Rondo by Haydn.\n\nHere Newman recognizes the creative value of Sors guitar sonatas but misconstrues several important points. Most significantly Newman falls into an easy association of Sors sonata style with that of Haydn and Boccherini. p1)\n... The present article examines the formal and stylistic procedures employed by Sor in his guitar sonatas determining appropriate models for these works and placing them in a likely chronological context. This examination affords a telling glimpse of Sor at two very different stages of his career as a young composer in Spain emulating the imported cosmopolitan highclassical style of the Italian opera overture and AustroFrench symphony and as an established postclassicist exercising a personal aesthetic and a confident individual approach to formal construction. p. 3)\n\nHow should one perform Sors music? I believe the answer is with considerably more freedom expression and passion than has for the most part been done in the recent past. Sor in his method of 1830 has much to say about the use of tone color on the guitar and even discusses how to imitate the various orchestral instruments. This use of color is something that is very uncommon amongst modern guitarists. Ironically Sor says very little about other aspects of expression but other guitar methods from the era do recommend much use of portamento arpeggiation of chords and other expressive devices which most people today consider anachronistic and completely out of style in the interpretation of the guitar music from this very era! It never ceases to amaze me how so many modern guitarists and musicologists ... dont even consider the wealth of material and instruction from Sors era which cries out that this music is meant to be expressed with such devices as dynamics tone color portamento chordal arpeggiation .... These same modern guitarists with the conspiratorial support of supposedly enlightened musicologists will often perform this music sometimes on a period guitar and use practically none of the abovementioned expressive devices\n\nWorks\nMusic\nOne of Sors popular compositions is his Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart Op. 9. It is based on the melody for Das klinget so herrlich das klinget so sch\u00f6n! from The Magic Flute composed in 1791.\n\nDidactic music\nSor was a prolific and in his time quite popular composer. There was a great demand for him to compose material that was approachable by less accomplished players. The resulting body of instructional studies he produced is not only noteworthy for its value to students of the guitar but for its inherent musicality. Much of this work is organized in several opus numbers in increasing order of difficulty Op. 60 25 lessons Op. 44 24 lessons Op. 35 24 exercises Op. 31 24 lessons Op. 6 12 studies and Op. 29 12 studies.\n\nDidactic manual\nSors M\u00e9thode pour la Guitare was first published in Paris in 1830 and translated into English by A Merrick in 1832 under the title Method for the Spanish Guitar.\n\nInstruments used by Sor\nSor undoubtedly played guitars by Pierre Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te mentioning M. Lacote a French maker the only person who besides his talents has proved to me that he possesses the quality of not being inflexible to reasoning.\nSome guitars of Lac\u00f4te show Sors signature Fernando Sor the Catalan man was out of his mind in Paris has signed a number of guitars by Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te  examples now survive in the Edinburgh University Collection of Historic Musical Instruments cat. no. 2521; and in private ownership exhibited at the Londen Early Music Instrument Makers Exhibition 1991). Sor also lent his name to the instruments of Louis Panormo of London. However in neither case is the instrument known then or now as a Sor model.\nA guitar of Lac\u00f4te that was signed by Sor is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 1. In his method Sor mentions ... if I wanted an instrument I would procure it from M. Joseph Martinez of Malaga or from M. Lacote ...The guitars to which I have always given the preference are those of Alonzo of Madrid Pag\u00e8s and Benediz of Cadiz Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga or Rada successor and scholar of the latter and those of M. Lacote of Paris. I do not say that others do not exist but never having tried them I cannot decide on that which I have no knowledge.  In his method he also mentions that J. Panormo of London and Mr. Schroeder of Petersburgh made some guitars under his direction but it is curious that he mentions them only in regard to his own guitar design ideas which are today partly critically viewed. Guitars made according to Sors design have not yet been located.\nAndr\u00e9s Segovia selected a set of twenty studies each emphasizing a particular aspect of technique these studies are now some of the best known works of Fernando Sor.\n\nSelected recordings\nFernando Sor Complete Studies for Guitar performed by Enea Leone on Brilliant Classics 94791 triple CD 2014).

He was ranked number 18 in Rolling Stone magazines list of greatest guitarists of all time. As a member of Rage Against the Machine he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nEarly life\nThomas Baptist Morello was born on May 30, 1964, in Harlem New York to parents Ngethe Njoroge and Mary Morello. Morello an only child is the son of an American mother of Italian and Irish descent and a Kenyan Kikuyu father. His mother was a schoolteacher from Marseilles Illinois who earned a Master of Arts at Loyola University Chicago and traveled to Germany Spain Japan and Kenya as an English language teacher between 1977 and 1983His father participated in the Mau Mau Uprising 1952\u20131960) and was Kenyas first ambassador to the United Nations. Morellos paternal greatuncle Jomo Kenyatta was the first elected president of Kenya. His aunt Jemimah Gecaga was the first woman to serve in the legislature of Kenya and his uncle Njoroge Mungai was a Kenyan Cabinet Minister Member of Parliament and was considered one of the founding fathers of modern Kenya. His parents met in August 1963 while attending a prodemocracy protest in Nairobi Kenya. After discovering her pregnancy Mary Morello returned to the United States with Njoroge in November and married in New York CityDenying paternity of his son Njoroge returned to his native Kenya when Morello was 16 months old. Morello was raised by his mother in Libertyville Illinois and attended Libertyville High School where his mother taught American history.\nMorello developed leftleaning political proclivities early following in his mothers footsteps. He described himself as having been the only anarchist in a conservative high school and has since identified as a nonsectarian socialist. In the 1980 mock elections at Libertyville he campaigned for a fictitious anarchist candidate named Hubie Maxwell who came in fourth place in the election. He wrote a piece headlined South Africa Racist Fascism That We Support for the school alternative newspaper The Student Pulse.\nMorello graduated from high school with honors in June 1982 and enrolled at Harvard University as a political science student that autumn. His band Bored of Education won the Ivy League Battle of the Bands in 1986 with Carolyn Bertozzi a laureate of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry on keyboards. Morello graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social studies. He moved to Los Angeles where he supported himself first by working as an exotic dancerWhen I graduated from Harvard and moved to Hollywood I was unemployable. I was literally starving so I had to work menial labor and at one point I even worked as an exotic dancer. Brick House by the Commodores was my jam! I did bachelorette parties and Id go down to my boxer shorts. Would I go further? All I can say is thank God it was in the time before YouTube! You could make decent money doing that job  people do what they have to do. Adam Jones a high school classmate moved to Los Angeles as well Morello introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey who would come to form the band ToolFrom 1987 to 1988, Morello worked in the office of United States Senator Alan Cranston DCA however this proved to be a negative experience for Morello who decided never to pursue a career in politicsI never had any real desire to work in politics but if there was any ember burning in me it was extinguished working in that job because of two things one of them was the fact that 80 per cent of the time I spent with the Senator he was on the phone asking rich people for money. It just made me understand that the whole business was dirty. He had to compromise his entire being every day.

Fredric and Patsy n\u00e9e Noah Levine an admissions counselor. They divorced when he was seven and Levine underwent therapy. Growing up he spent weekdays with his mother and weekends with his father. He has a younger brother. Levines father and maternal grandfather were Jewish while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish however according to The Jewish Chronicle he is spiritual but not religious. He chose not to have a Bar Mitzvah as a child because of the custom of receiving Bar Mitzvah gifts explaining I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just dont think its the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and years and years and years of cultural heritage. Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah and television producer and writer Peter NoahLevine describes his family as very musical and credits his mother with starting me out on the path. He also attributes his mothers idols  Simon  Garfunkel Fleetwood Mac and The Beatles  to shaping his musical style calling them a huge part of my upbringing. Levine attended Brentwood School where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden his future bandmates. He carried his musical interests to high school where he states he was a little rebellious. I didnt want to do the things they were teaching me ... music consumed my every thought.\n\nKaras Flowers\nIn February 1994, Levine along with friends Jesse Carmichael Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick formed garage band Karas Flowers. In 1995, the group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go a nightclub in West Hollywood California with Levine performing vocals and guitar. The band was discovered while they were performing in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen who along with his partner John DeNicola had them record an 11-track album. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob CavalloIn August 1997, the band released their first album titled The Fourth World and also appeared on an episode of the drama series Beverly Hills 90210. Despite high expectations it had little success selling about 5,000 copies. Reprise decided to drop the band after Cavallos exit from the label. Disappointed with the results of their album the band broke up. Later Levine would say of the experience Karas Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly put it out. No touring base no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesnt work.\n\nMaroon 5\nAfter the break up of Karas Flowers Levine along with Carmichael left Los Angeles to pursue higher studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News in 2002, he said Thats when I started waking up to the whole hiphop RB thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High. They dropped out after a semester and reunited with Madden and Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles including country and folk before deciding groovebased music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band We were just so sick of being a typical rock n roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration.  The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels before it caught the attention of Octone Records executives James Diener Ben Berkman and David Boxenbaum. Following Berkmans advice the band added a fifth member James Valentine and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters Berkman explained that Levine seemed to be a very shy shoegazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer Levine so he could be the star I perceived him to be.Around this time Levine had been working as a writers assistant on the CBS television show Judging Amy the programs producer Barbara Hall was his family friend. While on the show he would spend time writing songs about his exgirlfriend. These songs were put into Maroon 5's debut album Songs About Jane which was released in June 2002. The album slowly gained airplay and eventually became a sleeper hit selling an estimated 10 million copies and becoming the tenth bestselling album of 2004, two years after its release. In 2005, Maroon 5 won their first Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The next year they won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the second Songs About Jane single This Love.\nBy 2006, the band began recording again and in May 2007, Maroon 5's second album It Wont Be Soon Before Long was released. Levine described the album as a vast improvement explaining I think this record is a little more selfconfident and powerful lyrically. To support the album the band performed on a tendate club tour which visited small venues in Europe and the United States from April to June 2007. The album and its lead third and penultimate singles Makes Me Wonder Wont Go Home Without You and If I Never See Your Face Again respectively each received Grammy nominations although only Makes Me Wonder secured a winAfter winding down from a world tour in support of It Wont Be Soon Before Long the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter Robert John Mutt Lange. Levine said Lange worked me harder than anyone ever has. In 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over. The album did not initially meet expectations. In an interview with Los Angeles Times Levine explained that the album suffered from being all these disparate ideas and songs that didnt make any sense together. After the moderate success of the albums first three singles the band released Moves like Jagger which Levine classified as one of those songs that was definitely a risk its a bold statement. The single became a worldwide success it was the ninthbestselling digital single of 2011 with sales of 85 million copies and as of 2012, the eighthbestselling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with totally reviving the band.\nSince Moves Like Jagger was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer the band decided to attempt it again on their next album entitled Overexposed. Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levines public ubiquity. In an interview with Rolling Stone he opined that is their most dancedriven album ever commenting Its very much an oldfashioned disco tune. I have a lovehate relationship with it  but mostly I love it. The album and its lead single Payphone gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop DuoGroup Performance nominations. In support of Overexposed the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012 to 2013 with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts and also headlined the 2013 Honda Civic Tour which included The Voice contestant Tony LuccaIn 2014, Maroon 5 continued their collaboration with Ryan Tedder Max Martin and others to release their fifth studio album V pronounced five. Levine acknowledged that they followed the same songwriting process that they tried with Overexposed saying We developed a really nice system on the last record  we found songs we were passionate about developed them and put our stamp on them ... this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs. Five singles were released from it. In support of the album the band undertook the Maroon V Tour which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015In 2007, Levine had stated that he believed Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I dont know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond. But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up sayingI love what I do and think that yes it might be tiring and complicated at times but we dont have any plans on disbanding any time soon. He has also turned down the idea of having a solo career stating that there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band.

He found music as an outlet for his feelings stating I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so madly in love with it its all I did. He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve but he was so nervous that he played with his back to the audience. Throughout his childhood he had a wide range of musical influences including The Beatles Fleetwood Mac The Who Pearl Jam Soundgarden Alice in Chains and Nirvana and in high school Bob Marley Bill Withers Al Green Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye Phish and Michael Jackson. He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. In an interview with Billboard he explained the diversity of his influences I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avantgarde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the 70s.Levine remembers that listening to Are You That Somebody? by Aaliyah convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of the band he was performing with at the time Karas Flowers. His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved hiphop RB gospel and soul music. He took to changing his musical style extensively emulating Stevie Wonder. Subsequently Songs About Jane was released deemed  bluesy funk and similar to the sound of English pop rock band Busted. Critics also drew comparisons between Levine and Jamiroquai singer Jay KayWhile earlier work was deemed vaguely funky whitesoul and rock recent ones have been judged to have a more reggae anthemic pop sound evoking comparisons to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre saying Theres so much variety in music its silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way. He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes acknowledging Romance love the lack thereof are still very big themes. I havent figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter Im still limited to that one thing. He also claims he does not like mincing words stating in a Rolling Stone interview I was so sick of typical lyrics like Ooh baby and I love you and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach.\nLevine is a tenor with a 4 octave vocal range and has been noted for his falsettos. Salon wrote When hes crooning comeons his voice lends the music a satisfying lewdness a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency. In a review of It Wont Be Soon Before Long Entertainment Weekly described his vocals as smug RBslick deadpan ... theres a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery. In another review Allmusic wrote he knows that hes a pop guy somewhat in the tradition of Hall  Oates but he isnt trying to be retro hes ... making records that are melodic stylish and soulful. In a review of the 2013 Honda Civic Tour The Boston Globe also commented positively on his onstage presence which exudes a sense of upforanything playfulness ... combined with a rock solid work ethic and a clear love for their audiences and performing.Levines popularity outside of his musical work has seen him tagged as a standalone star which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely others opine that Levines fame has been a boost to the band with Paper writing Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks in no small part to their frontmans uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining. Delta Sky described him as a natural if slightly neurotic leading man. He claims that the image was consciously cultivated explaining We talked about it a long time ago and decided I would step out for us not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman.\n\nPersonal life\nIn early 2010, while performing at the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas Levine met Russian Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue model Anne Vyalitsyna and they soon began a relationship.

Prior to the Eagles he was a member of three country rock bands Hearts  Flowers Dillard  Clark and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multiinstrumentalist guitar banjo mandolin steel guitar dobro coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles.\nLeadons music career since leaving the Eagles has been lowkey resulting in two solo albums the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades with a gap of 27 years in between. Leadon has also appeared on many other artists records as a session musician.\n\nEarly life and musical beginnings\nIn San Diego California Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent including shy 18-yearold mandolin player Chris Hillman with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player and future Flying Burrito Brother Kenny Wertz the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group upon Wertzs joining the Air Force in 1963He later met  future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder whose band the Continentals had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills. \nA call from exSquirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic countryfolk group Hearts  Flowers brought Leadon to California where he became involved with the burgeoning LA. folkcountry rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band its second release Of Horses Kids and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged the group disbanded the following year.\n\nDillard  Clark\nBy late 1968, Leadon had befriended bluegrassbanjo legend Doug Dillard late of the Dillards. While staying with Dillard informal jam sessions with songwriter and exByrds member Gene Clark began to take shape and morphed into what eventually became the countryrock band Dillard  Clark. In 1968, the group recorded The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard  Clark featuring Leadons backing vocals and multiinstrumental work. The album included several compositions cowritten with Clark most notably the future Eagles staple and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon from their debut album Train Leaves Here This Morning.\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers\nLeadon left Dillard  Clark in 1969, eventually reconnecting with exSquirrel Barker and exByrd Chris Hillman who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers a fledgling countryrock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow exByrd Gram Parsons. Leadon recorded two albums with the group Burrito Deluxe and the postParsons LP The Flying Burrito Bros. After the latter albums release in 1971, Leadon had tired of the bands lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in Linda Ronstadts backing band that summer forming the Eagles.\n\nEagles\nLeadon was the last original member to join the Eagles a band initially formed by guitaristsinger Glenn Frey drummersinger Don Henley and former Poco bassistsinger Randy Meisner. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the bands early countryrock sound bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were electric guitar BBender acoustic guitar banjo mandolin dobro and pedal steel guitar.\nUpon the release of their debut album Eagles the group met with near instant success due largely to the strength of their hit singles Take It Easy Peaceful Easy Feeling and Witchy Woman cowritten by Leadon and Henley all of which highlighted Leadons multiinstrumental talent on electric guitar BBender banjo and harmony vocals. Their followup Desperado was another strong countryrock venture highlighted by the classics Tequila Sunrise and the title track. Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result the band attempted to distance itself from the country rock label for their third album On the Border. In doing so Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend guitarist Don Felder to the band. The result was the guitarheavy top 40 hit Already Gone. The album also included My Man Leadons touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend Gram Parsons who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at Joshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California.\nWith the wild success of On the Border and its followup smash One of These Nights tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the bands direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward albumoriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Freys head. He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band.\nUpon Leadons departure Asylum Records released Their Greatest Hits 1971\u20131975) which highlighted the bands Leadon years and went on to become the bestselling album in United States history with sales in excess of 38 million units. He was replaced by former James Gang guitarist and singer Joe Walsh.\nAlthough it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll Leadon denies it and said in 2013, Thats an oversimplification it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. Thats just not the case. I didnt just play Fender Telecaster. I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock  roll. Thats evident from the early albums.\n\nLater career\nUpon leaving the Eagles Leadon retreated from the limelight only to resurface in 1977 with musician friend Michael Georgiades for the album Natural Progressions credited to The Bernie LeadonMichael Georgiades Band featuring Leadon and Georgiades on guitars and alternating lead vocals along with Bryan Garofalo on bass Dave Kemper on drums and Steve Goldstein on keyboard.\nIn 1985, he recorded an album of bluegrass and gospel favorites under the name Ever Call Ready featuring Chris Hillman and Al Perkins. He also had a short stint with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the late 1980s.\nIn 1993, he became a member of Run CW a novelty group singing Motown hits bluegrass style recording two albums for MCA Records.\nIn 1998, Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the bands induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on Take It Easy and Hotel California.\nIn 2004, he released his second solo effort in 27 years and his first under solely his name Mirror.\nLeadon toured with the Eagles from 2013 through 2015 during their History of the Eagles Tour In 2015, Leadon appeared on producer Ethan Johns third solo album Silver Liner.\nIn February 2016, Leadon appeared at the Grammy Awards ceremony with Jackson Browne and the surviving Eagles members  Don Henley Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit  performing Take it Easy in tribute to Glenn Frey who had died a month earlier.\n\nPersonal life\nFor a few years in the mid1970s Leadon lived in Topanga Canyon a bohemian enclave known for its musician residents. Leadons houseplusrecordingstudio had previously been owned by singersongwriter Neil Young and was the site of frequent parties. Leadon lived with Patti Davis the freespirited daughter of conservative California Governor Ronald Reagan who was at that time campaigning for president and distancing himself from his daughter because Leadon and she were unmarried but living together. Leadon and Davis cowrote the song I Wish You Peace which Leadon insisted the Eagles include on the album One of These Nights against the wishes of his bandmates.\n\nDiscography\nReferences\nSources\nElliot Marc 1998).

However Psomass heroin habit hindered them from working consistently. Dean would go back to work with Corrosion of Conformity Psomas died of an overdose in 1994DuVall spent the late 1980s with a Hendrixinspired band No Walls.

According to Cantrell it only took one audition for DuVall to get the gig. For his first rehearsal with the band DuVall sang Alice in Chains Love Hate Love. After they finished drummer Sean Kinney looked at his bandmates and said I think the search is pretty much over. According to bassist Mike Inez DuVall didnt try to emulate Staley and thats what drew them to him. DuVall revealed that Ann Wilson of Heart was supposed to sing Rooster at the show but during the camera blocking rehearsals he was on stage and Ann hadnt made it downstairs yet so they said Would you sing Rooster for the camera blocking? and he did. DuVall credits Ann Wilson for giving him a spot on the TV show because that moment served as the comingout party for the new incarnation of Alice in ChainsInitially Cantrell and the other veteran members of the band had said the reunion didnt necessarily foretell a future for the band and that it was just a tribute to Staley and their fans. Kinney went further saying he would have liked to change the bands name and adding I dont see continuing as Alice and replacing somebody. DuVall expressed similar sentiments with regards to the task of filling in for Staley. However the reformed Alice in Chains generated enthusiasm from fans and convinced the four to keep the nameIn 2007, Alice in Chains began touring with Velvet Revolver and Kill Hannah.

However DuVall stated that there was a possibility of another album in the near future commenting It would be fairly safe to say that you dont come this far and do all this work just to stop for another 15 years.In March 2011, it was announced that Alice in Chains would begin recording a new album at the tail end of 2011. In May 2013, the album The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here was released. DuVall sings lead vocals on the songs Hung on a Hook and Phantom Limb.

He cowrote many of the bands songs with frontman and original lead singer Ronnie Van Zant.\n\nEarly life\nCollins was born in Jacksonville Florida. He started playing guitar at 12 years of age with a few lessons from his stepmother Leila Collins a countryandwestern guitarist and received his first guitar and amplifier from his mother. Inspired by the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, he formed his first group The Mods with friends Larry Steele bass Donnie Ulsh guitar and James Rice drums. Collins attended Nathan B. Forrest High SchoolIn 1970, Collins married Kathy Johns. All of his bandmates were in his wedding party but Kathy worried that the bands long haired appearance would disturb her parents. To solve this problem she required all the band members to keep their hair under wigs at the wedding ceremony. The wedding reception was one of the first public performances of Free Bird complete with the trademark extended guitar jam at the end. Collinss family grew with the birth of his daughter Amie followed quickly by Allison. Collins was fond of cars and had an extensive car collection one of his favorites being a 1932 Plymouth coupe nicknamed Dixie Blue.\n\nCareer\nAllen Collins joined Skynyrd in Jacksonville Florida just two weeks after its formation by Ronnie Van Zant and Gary Rossington along with Bob Burns and Larry Junstrom. Knowing that Collins played guitar and owned his own equipment the band decided to approach him about joining them. Van Zant and Burns both had a reputation for trouble and Collins fled on his bicycle and hid up a tree when he saw them pull up in his driveway. They soon convinced him that they were not there to beat him up and he agreed to join the band then known as The One Percent.Collins and lead singer Ronnie Van Zant cowrote many of the biggest Skynyrd hits including Free Bird Gimme Three Steps and That Smell. The band received national success beginning in 1973 while opening for the Who on their Quadrophenia tour.\n\nOn October 20, 1977, an airplane carrying the band crashed into a forest in Mississippi killing three band members including Van Zant. Collins was seriously injured in the crash suffering two broken vertebrae in his neck and severe damage to his right arm. While amputation was recommended Collins father refused and he eventually recovered.\nDuring the early 1980s Collins continued to perform on stage in the RossingtonCollins Band which enjoyed modest success releasing two albums Anytime Anyplace Anywhere and This Is the Way and charting a few singles notably Dont Misunderstand Me.\nTragedy struck again just as the Rossington Collins Band was getting off the ground. In 1980, during the first days of the debut concert tour Collinss wife Kathy died suddenly of a hemorrhage during the miscarriage of their third child. This forced the tours cancellation. With the lingering effects of losing his friends in the plane crash Kathys death devastated Collins.\nThe RossingtonCollins Band disbanded in 1982. Collins continued to pursue music starting the Allen Collins Band which released one album Here There  Back in 1983. The six members included two Skynyrd bandmates  keyboardist Billy Powell and bassist Leon Wilkeson  along with lead singer Jimmy Dougherty drummer Derek Hess and guitarists Barry Lee Harwood and Randall Hall.

Collins pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter as well as driving under the influence of alcohol. Due to his injuries he would never play guitar on stage again.\nCollins last performance with Lynyrd Skynyrd was at the bands first reunion after the plane crash at the 1979 Volunteer Jam V in Nashville Tennessee. All remaining members of Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited officially in 1987, but Collins served only as musical director due to his paralysis.  As part of his plea bargain for the 1986 accident Collins addressed fans at every Skynyrd concert with an explanation of why he could not perform citing the dangers of drinking and driving as well as drugs and alcohol. Also because of Collins accident the band donated a sizable amount of concert proceeds from the 1987\u201388 tour to the Miami Project which is involved in treatment of paralysis. Collins founded Roll For Rock Wheelchair Events and Benefit Concerts in 1988 to raise awareness and to provide opportunities for those living with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities.\nAllen Collins died on January 23, 1990, from chronic pneumonia a complication of the paralysis. He is buried beside his wife in Jacksonville Florida.\nIn 2006, Collins was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nInstruments\nIn the early days of Lynyrd Skynyrd Collins used a black Gibson Flying V. This guitar was stolen along with Gary Rossingtons white Gibson SG when the bands van was broken into after a gig. For most of his tenure in Skynyrd Collins used a Gibson Firebird fitted with a chromecovered dogeared P90 pickup in the bridge position and a Gibson teaspoon nickel vibrato arm. In 1976 he switched to a naturalfinished korina 1958 Gibson Explorer that he had bought for about 3,000 and used that guitar throughout his tenure with the Allen Collins Band.\nIn late 1977 Collins began occasionally playing a Gibson Les Paul Special with a double cutaway P90s a sunburst finish and modded with a Lyre Tremolo. He continued to use this guitar in the Rossington Collins Band as well. On Gimme Back My Bullets Sweet Home Alabama Every Mothers Son Collins used a Sunburst Fender Stratocaster after Ed King had left.

In 1975, he switched to an instrumental style with focus on an innovative sound and his releases spanned genres and styles ranging from blues rock hard rock jazz fusion and a blend of guitarrock and electronica.\nBeck was ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone and other magazines lists of the greatest guitarists. He was often called a guitarists guitarist. Rolling Stone described him as one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock. Although he recorded two successful albums in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act Beck did not establish or maintain commercial success like that of his contemporaries and bandmates. He recorded with many artistsBeck earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once. In 2014, he received the British Academys Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Beck was named the 5th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone in 2023.\n\nEarly life\nBeck was born on 24 June 1944 to Arnold and Ethel Beck at 206 Demesne Road Wallington Surrey now in Greater London. As a tenyearold Beck sang in a church choir. He had a sister Annetta. He attended Sutton Manor School and Sutton East County Secondary Modern SchoolBeck cited Les Paul as the first electric guitar player who impressed him. Beck said that he first heard an electric guitar when he was six years old and heard Paul playing How High the Moon on the radio. He asked his mother what it was. After she replied it was an electric guitar and was all tricks he said Thats for me. Cliff Gallup lead guitarist with Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps was also an early musical influence followed by B. B. King and Steve Cropper. Beck considered Lonnie Mack a rock guitarist who was unjustly overlooked and a major influence on him and many others.As a teenager he learned to play on a borrowed guitar and made several attempts to build his own instrument first by gluing and bolting together cigar boxes for the body and an unsanded fence post for the neck with model aircraft control lines and frets simply painted on itAfter leaving school he attended Wimbledon School of Art now Wimbledon College of Arts. Then he was briefly employed as a painter and decorator a groundsman on a golf course and a car paint sprayer. Becks sister Annetta introduced him to Jimmy Page when both were teenagers.\n\nCareer\n1960s\nWhile attending Wimbledon College of Art Beck played in a succession of groups including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages during 1964 when they recorded Draculas DaughterCome Back Baby for Oriole RecordsIn 1963, after Ian Stewart of the Rolling Stones introduced him to RB he formed The Nightshift with whom he played at the 100 Club in Oxford Street. Beck joined the Rumbles a Croydon band in 1963 for a short period as lead guitarist playing Gene Vincent and Buddy Holly songs displaying a talent for mimicking guitar styles. Later in 1963, he joined the Tridents a band from the Chiswick area. They were really my scene because they were playing flatout RB like Jimmy Reed stuff and we supercharged it all up and made it really rocky. I got off on that even though it was only twelvebar blues. He was a session guitarist on a 1964 Parlophone single by the Fitz and Startz titled Im Not Running Away with Bside So Sweet.\n\nIn March 1965, Beck was recruited by the Yardbirds to succeed Eric Clapton on the recommendation of fellow session musician Jimmy Page who had been their initial choice. The Yardbirds recorded most of their Top 40 hit songs during Becks short but significant 20-month tenure with the band allowing him only one full album which became known as Roger the Engineer titled Over Under Sideways Down in the US released in 1966. In May 1966, Beck recorded an instrumental titled Becks Bolero. Rather than members of the Yardbirds he was backed by Page on 12-string rhythm guitar Keith Moon on drums John Paul Jones on bass and Nicky Hopkins on piano. In June Page joined the Yardbirds at first on bass and later on second lead guitar. This dual leadguitar lineup was filmed performing an adaptation of Train Kept ARollin titled Stroll On for the 1966 Michelangelo Antonioni film Blow UpBeck was fired during a US. tour for being a consistent noshowas well as difficulties caused by his perfectionism and explosive temper on stage. In 1967, he recorded several solo singles for pop producer Mickie Most including Hi Ho Silver Lining and Tallyman which also included his vocals. He then formed the Jeff Beck Group which included Rod Stewart on vocals Ronnie Wood on bass Nicky Hopkins on piano and Aynsley Dunbar on drums replaced by Micky Waller.The group produced two albums for Columbia Records Epic in the US Truth as Jeff Beck August 1968) and BeckOla July 1969). Truth released five months before the first Led Zeppelin album features You Shook Me a song written by Willie Dixon and first recorded by Muddy Waters also covered on the Led Zeppelin debut with a similar arrangement.  It sold well reaching No. 15 on the Billboard charts. BeckOla saw drummer Micky Waller replaced by Tony Newman and while wellreceived was less successful both commercially and critically. Resentment coupled with touring incidents led the group to disband in July 1969.\nIn his autobiography Nick Mason recalls that during 1967 Pink Floyd had wanted to recruit Beck to be its guitarist after the departure of Syd Barrett but none of us had the nerve to ask him. In 1969, following the death of Brian Jones Beck was approached about joining the Rolling StonesAfter the breakup of his group Beck took part in the Music from Free Creek super session project billed as A. N. Other and contributed lead guitar on four songs including one cowritten by him. In September 1969, he teamed with the rhythm section of Vanilla Fudge bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice when they were in England to resolve contractual issues but when Beck fractured his skull in a car accident near Maidstone in December the plan was postponed for twoandahalf years during which time Bogert and Appice formed Cactus. Beck later remarked on the 1960s period of his life Everyone thinks of the 1960s as something they really werent. It was the frustration period of my life. The electronic equipment just wasnt up to the sounds I had in my head.\n\n1970s\nIn 1970, after Beck had regained his health he set about forming a band with the drummer Cozy Powell. Beck Powell and producer Mickie Most flew to the United States and recorded several tracks at Motowns famed Studio A in Hitsville USA. with the Funk Brothers Motowns inhouse band but the results remained unreleased. By April 1971 Beck had completed the lineup of this new group with guitaristvocalist Bobby Tench keyboard player Max Middleton and bassist Clive Chaman. The new band performed as The Jeff Beck Group but had a substantially different sound from the first lineupRough and Ready October 1971) the first album they recorded on which Beck wrote or cowrote six of the albums seven tracks the exception being written by Middleton included elements of soul rhythmandblues and jazz foreshadowing the direction Becks music would take later in the decade.\nA second album Jeff Beck Group July 1972) was recorded at TMI studios in Memphis with the same personnel. Beck employed Steve Cropper as producer and the album displayed a strong soul influence five of the nine tracks being covers of songs by American artists. One I Got to Have a Song was the first of four Stevie Wonder compositions covered by Beck. Shortly after the release of the Jeff Beck Group album the band was dissolved and Becks management put out the statement that The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians but they didnt feel it had led to the creation of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought. Beck then started collaborating with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice who became available following the demise of Cactus but continued touring as the Jeff Beck Group in August 1972, to fulfill contractual obligations with his promoter with a lineup including Bogert Appice Max Middleton and vocalist Kim Milford. After six appearances Milford was replaced by Bobby Tench who was flown in from the United Kingdom for the Arie Crown Theatre Chicago performance and the rest of the tour which concluded at the Paramount North West Theatre Seattle. After the tour Tench and Middleton left the band and the power trio Beck Bogert  Appice emerged. Appice took on the role of vocalist with Bogert and Beck contributing occasionallyThey were included on the bill for Rock at The Oval in September 1972, still as The Jeff Beck Group which marked the start of a tour schedule of the United Kingdom the Netherlands and Germany. Another US. tour began in October 1972, starting at the Hollywood Sportatorium Florida and concluding on 11 November 1972 at The Warehouse in New Orleans. In April 1973 the album Beck Bogert  Appice was released on Epic Records. While critics acknowledged the bands instrumental prowess the album was not commercially well received except for its cover of Stevie Wonders hit Superstition.\nOn 3 July 1973 Beck joined David Bowie onstage to perform The Jean GenieLove Me Do and Around and Around. The show was filmed and was finally released in the 2022 Bowie documentary Moonage Daydream.

Their live album Beck Bogert  Appice Live in Japan recorded during their 1973 tour of Japan was not released until February 1975 by EpicSonyAfter a few months Beck entered Underhill Studio and met with the band Upp he recruited them to be the backing band for his appearance on the BBC TV program Guitar Workshop in August 1974. Beck produced and played on their selftitled debut album and their second album This Way Upp though his contributions to the second album went uncredited. During 1974 he participated in recording sessions for the first album by former Jeff Beck Group member Bobby Tenchs band Hummingbird but did not contribute to the album. In October the same year Beck began to record instrumental sessions at AIR Studios with Max Middleton who was also associated with Hummingbird bassist Phil Chen and drummer Richard Bailey using George Martin as producer and arranger. These formed the basis for Becks solo album  Blow by Blow March 1975) and showcased Becks technical prowess in jazzrock. The album reached number four in the charts and is Becks most commercially successful release. Beck fastidious about overdubs and often dissatisfied with his solos often returned to AIR Studios until he was satisfied. A couple of months after the sessions had finished producer George Martin received a telephone call from Beck who wanted to record a solo section again. Bemused Martin replied Im sorry Jeff but the record is in the shops!Beck put together a live band for a US tour which was preceded by a small and unannounced gig at The Newlands Tavern in Peckham London. He toured through April and May 1975, mostly supporting the Mahavishnu Orchestra retaining Max Middleton on keyboards but with a new rhythm section of bassist Wilbur Bascomb and noted session drummer Bernard Pretty Purdie who interestingly was also associated with Hummingbird.\nIn a May 1975 show in Cleveland at the Music Hall he became frustrated with an early version of a talk box he used on his arrangement of the Beatles Shes a Woman and after breaking a string tossed his legendary Yardbirdsera Fender Stratocaster guitar off the stage. He did the same with the talk box and finished the show playing a Les Paul guitar without the box. During this tour he performed at Yuya Uchidas World Rock Festival playing eight songs with Purdie. In addition he performed a guitar and drum instrumental with Johnny Yoshinaga and at the end of the festival joined in a live jam with bassist Felix Pappalardi of Mountain and vocalist Akira Joe Yamanaka from the Flower Travellin Band. Only his set with Purdie was recorded and releasedHe returned to the studio and recorded Wired 1976) which paired exMahavishnu Orchestra drummer and composer Narada Michael Walden and keyboardist Jan Hammer.

This resulted in the live album Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live 1977).At this point Beck was a tax exile and took up residency in the US remaining there until his return to the UK in the autumn of 1977.

They had been recording music together for some time with the track being produced the year before but Beck explained that the decision to release it was influenced by the COVID19 pandemic lockdowns We werent expecting to release it so soon but given all the hard days and true isolation that people are going through in these challenging times we decided now might be the right time to let you all hear it.On 2 June 2022, Beck appeared in the news after Depp appeared with him at The Sage in Gateshead following his victory in the highprofile defamation case against his exwife Amber Heard.

Beck said John McLaughlin has given us so many different facets of the guitar and introduced thousands of us to world music by blending Indian music with jazz and classical. Id say he was the best guitarist alive. McLaughlin also praised Beck calling Beck his favorite progressive rock artistAccording to musicologist and historian Bob Gulla Beck is credited for popularising the use of audio feedback and distortion on guitar. During his short time with the Yardbirds Becks experimentation with feedback distortion and fuzz tone pushed the band into directions that would open the door for psychedelic rock while jolting British rock forward according to Gulla. While Beck was not the first rock guitarist to experiment with electronic distortion he nonetheless helped to redefine the sound and role of the electric guitar in rock music.  His use of a commercial fuzz box for the Yardbirds Heart Full of Soul June 1965) has been cited as perhaps the first significant use of the effect. Becks work with the Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Groups 1968 album Truth were seminal influences on heavy metal music which emerged in full force in the early 1970s. Gulla identifies one of Becks characteristic traits to be his sense of pitch particularly in exercising the whammy bar to create sounds ranging from nosediving bombs to subtle perfectly pitched harmonic melodies.According to guitarist and author Jack Wilkins Beck is regarded alongside Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as one of his generations greatest guitarists receiving praise for his technical skill and versatile playing. Stephen Thomas Erlewine finds him to be as innovative as Jimmy Page as tasteful as Eric Clapton and nearly as visionary as Jimi Hendrix although unable to achieve their mainstream success primarily because of the haphazard way he approached his career while often lacking a star singer to help make his music more accessible. On his recorded output by 1991, Erlewine remarked that never has such a gifted musician had such a spotty discography believing Beck had largely released remarkably uneven solo records and only a few terrific albums. In Christgaus Record Guide 1981) Robert Christgau essentialised Beck as a technician and questioned his ability to improvise long lines or jazz it up with a modicum of delicacy or for that matter get funky although he later observed a customary focus loyalty and consistency of taste.In 2015, Beck was ranked No. 5 in Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists. In an accompanying essay guitarist Mike Campbell applauded Beck for his brilliant technique and personality in his playing including a sense of humour expressed through the growl of his wahwah effects. Campbell also credited Beck with expanding the boundaries of the blues particularly in his two collaborations with Stewart.\n\nTechnique and equipment\nBecks principal guitar was the Fender Stratocaster which he used in various iterations throughout his career. Beck stopped the regular use of a guitar pick in the 1980s. He produced a wide variety of sounds by using his thumb to pluck the guitar strings his ring finger on the volume knob and his little finger on the vibrato bar. By plucking a string and then fading in the sound with the volume knob he created a unique sound that can resemble a human voice among other effects. He frequently used a wahwah pedal both live and in the studio. Eric Clapton once said With Jeff its all in his hands.Along with Stratocasters Beck occasionally played Fender Telecaster and Gibson Les Paul models as well. His amplifiers were primarily Fender and Marshall. In his earlier days with the Yardbirds Beck also used a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar now owned by Seymour W. Duncan and housed in the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame through Vox AC30s. He also played through a variety of fuzz pedals and echo units along with this setup and used the Pro Co RAT distortion pedal. The pickup is based on a Gibson pickup rewound by Duncan and used in a salvaged Telecaster dubbed the TeleGib which he had constructed as a gift to Beck. Scott Morgan of the Rationals who at one point shared a dressing room with the Yardbirds recalls how Beck amplified his lead guitar through a Vox Super Beatle while using banjo strings for the unwound G string on his guitar because they didnt make sets with an unwound G at that point.In 1991, Fender released the Jeff Beck Stratocaster with changes made to the model in 2001. An additional Custom Shop version was released in 2004.\n\nLong term collaborators\nThe graph below includes musicians whove worked on multiple occasions concerts or published music with Jeff Beck or for a long time continuously been on more than one album with him or have done at least quite a substantial part of a tour with him. Overlap between personnel and albums on this graph does not always mean that that personnel was present on that album as some parallel projects overlapped in time.\n\nPersonal life and death\nFrom 1963 to 1967, Beck was married to Patricia Brown. However this relationship had deteriorated by the time Beck joined the Yardbirds. During the Yardbirds years Beck began a relationship with American model and actress Mary Hughes whom he moved in with when his relationship with the Yardbirds broke down. By 1968, Beck had entered what would be a nearly 18-year relationship with the English model Celia Hammond whose portrait appears on the album cover of Truth. In 2005, he married Sandra Cash. He had no children. At the time of his death Beck lived in a Grade IIlisted building called Riverhall in the civil parish of Wadhurst East Sussex. Beck became a vegetarian in 1969 and was a patron of the Folly Wildlife Rescue Trust. He also had an interest in classic Ford hot rods performing much of the work on the exteriors and engines of the cars by himselfBeck died from a bacterial meningitis infection at a hospital near Riverhall on 10 January 2023, at the age of 78. Within minutes of his death announcement musicians and friends began paying tribute Jimmy Page wrote that The six stringed Warrior is no longer here for us to admire the spell he could weave around our mortal emotions. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal. His technique unique. His imaginations apparently limitless. Jeff I will miss you along with your millions of fans. Mick Jagger expressed his condolences writing With the death of Jeff Beck we have lost a wonderful man and one of the greatest guitar players in the world. We will all miss him so much. Ronnie Wood a former bandmate of Becks stated Now Jeff has gone I feel like one of my band of brothers has left this world and Im going to dearly miss him. Becks funeral took place at St Marys Church in Beddington Sutton on 3 February. Mourners included Johnny Depp Rod Stewart Eric Clapton Tom Jones Ronnie Wood David Gilmour Bob Geldof Robert Plant and Chrissie Hynde.

He first found fame as a member of the Byrds with whom he helped pioneer the genres of folk rock and psychedelia in the mid1960s and later as part of the supergroup Crosby Stills  Nash who helped popularize the California sound of the 1970s. In addition to his music Crosby was known for his outspoken personality politics and personal troubles he was sometimes depicted as emblematic of the counterculture of the 1960sAfter a short time performing in the folk music scene Crosby cofounded the Byrds in 1964. They scored their first numberone hit in 1965 with a cover of Bob Dylans Mr. Tambourine Man. Crosby appeared on the Byrds first five albums and the original lineups 1973 reunion album. In 1968, he formed Crosby Stills  Nash CSN with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. After the release of their debut album CSN won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 1969. The group later occasionally included Neil Young. The core trio of CSN remained active from 1976 until 2016, and the duo of Crosby  Nash also recorded three gold albums in the 1970s. Crosby Stills Nash  Young CSNY reunions were held in each decade from the 1970s through the 2000s.\nCrosby released eight solo albums albeit sporadically over the course of his career. His solo debut was 1971's If I Could Only Remember My Name. The last five of his solo albums beginning with Croz 2014) came in the last decade of his life. Additionally he formed a jazzinfluenced trio with his son James Raymond and guitarist Jeff Pevar in CPR. He also appeared frequently on recordings by other artists including Joni Mitchell Jefferson Airplane Jackson Browne James Taylor and David Gilmour.\nCrosbys combined work with the Byrds and CSNY has sold over 35 million albums. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice once for his work in the Byrds and again for his work with CSN. Five albums to which he contributed are included in Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time three with the Byrds and two with CSNY.\nHe was also an occasional actor appearing as a member of Captain Hooks pirate crew in Hook 1991).\n\nEarly years\nDavid Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles California the second son of Academy Awardwinning cinematographer Floyd Crosby who formerly worked on Wall Street and Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead a salesperson at Macys department store. His father was a relative of the Van Rensselaer family and his mothergranddaughter of Bishop of Pittsburgh Cortlandt Whiteheaddescended from the prominent Van Cortlandt family they regularly inhabited the New York society pages before their wedding.Crosbys older brother was musician Ethan Crosby. His brother inspired his early love of jazz particularly John Coltrane and Miles Davis the latter would later recommend that Columbia Records sign the Byrds and then cover the Crosby composition Guinnevere. Their parents divorced in 1960, and his father then married Betty Cormack AndrewsGrowing up in California he attended several schools including the University Elementary School in Los Angeles the Crane Country Day School in Montecito and Laguna Blanca School in Santa Barbara for the rest of his elementary school and junior high years. At Crane he starred in HMS. Pinafore and other musicals but he flunked out. Crosby finished high school via correspondence courses from the Cate School in Carpinteria. He briefly attended Carpinteria Union High School in 1958. Ethan Chip had been at CUHS before David. At CUHS David was given the lead in the Junior Class Play.\n\nMusical career\nThe Byrds\nCrosby briefly studied drama at Santa Barbara City College before dropping out to pursue a career in music. He performed with singer Terry Callier in Chicago and Greenwich Village but the duo failed to obtain a recording contract. He also performed with Les Baxters Balladeers in 1964/1965 and published four singles in 1965, including a cover of the Beatless song Michelle. With the help of producer Jim Dickson Crosby recorded his first solo session in 1963, with a cover of a song by Ray Charles. Miriam Makeba was on tour and in Chicago at the time with her band which included Jim McGuinn a multiinstrumentalist who later dropped his first name and began to go by his middle name Roger McGuinn. Callier introduced Crosby to McGuinn  and Gene Clark who were then performing by the name the Jet Set. Crosby joined them and they were augmented by drummer Michael Clarke at which point Crosby attempted unsuccessfully to play bass. Late in 1964, Chris Hillman joined the band as bassist and Crosby relieved Gene Clark of rhythm guitar duties.\nThrough connections that Jim Dickson The Byrds manager had with Bob Dylans music publisher the band obtained a demo acetate disc of Dylans Mr. Tambourine Man and recorded a version of the song featuring McGuinns twelvestring guitar as well as McGuinn Crosby and Clarks vocal harmonies. The song was a massive hit reaching No. 1 in the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom during 1965. While McGuinn originated the Byrds trademark 12-string guitar sound Crosby was responsible for the soaring harmonies and often unusual phrasing of their songs. While he did not sing lead vocals on either of the first two albums he sang lead on the bridge in their second single All I Really Want to Do.In 1966, Clark who then was the bands primary songwriter left the group because of stress and this placed all the groups songwriting responsibilities in the hands of McGuinn Crosby and Hillman. Crosby took the opportunity to hone his craft and soon became a relatively prolific songwriter collaborating with McGuinn on the uptempo I See You covered by Yes on their 1969 debut and penning the ruminative Whats Happening. His early Byrds efforts also included the 1966 hit Eight Miles High to which he contributed one line according to Clark while Clark and McGuinn wrote the rest and its flip side Why cowritten with McGuinnBecause Crosby felt responsible for and was widely credited with popularizing the song Hey Joe he persuaded the other members of the Byrds to record it on Fifth Dimension.  By Younger Than Yesterday the Byrds 1967 album Crosby began to find his trademark style on songs such as Renaissance Fair cowritten with McGuinn Mind Gardens and It Happens Each Day however the latter song was omitted from the final album and ultimately restored as a bonus track on the 1996 remastered edition. The album also contained a rerecording of Why and Everybodys Been Burned a jazzy torch song from Crosbys preByrds repertoire that was initially demoed in 1963Friction between Crosby and the other Byrds came to a head in early to mid1967. Tensions were high after the Monterey International Pop Festival in June when Crosbys onstage political diatribes and support of various John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories between songs outraged McGuinn. He further annoyed his bandmates when at the invitation of Stephen Stills he sat in with Buffalo Springfields set the following night after Young had quit the band and was replaced by guitarist Doug Hastings. The internal conflict boiled over during the initial recording sessions for The Notorious Byrd Brothers 1968) that summer where differences over song selections led to intraband arguments. In particular Crosby was adamant that the band should record only original material despite the recent commercial failure of Lady Friend a Crosbypenned single that stalled at No. 82 on the American charts following its release. McGuinn and Hillman dismissed Crosby in October after he refused to countenance the recording of a cover of Goffin and Kings Goin Back. While Crosby contributed to three compositions and five recordings on the final album his controversial m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois ode Triad was omitted. Jefferson Airplane released a Grace Slicksung cover on Crown of Creation 1968) and three years later Crosby released a solo acoustic version on Crosby Stills Nash  Youngs double live album 4 Way Street 1971). The Byrds version appeared decades later on the 1987 Never Before release and later on the 1997 rerelease of The Notorious Byrd BrothersIn 1973, Crosby reunited with the original Byrds for the album Byrds with Crosby acting as the albums producer. The album charted well at No. 20, their best album showing since their second album but was generally not perceived to be a critical success. It marked the final artistic collaboration of the original band.\n\nCrosby Stills Nash  Young\nAround the time of Crosbys departure from the Byrds in 1968, he met Stephen Stills at Laurel Canyon in California through Cass Elliot of the Mamas  the Papas and the two started meeting informally and jamming together. They were soon joined by Graham Nash who would leave his commercially successful group the Hollies to play with Crosby and Stills. Their appearance at the Woodstock Music and Art Fair in August 1969 constituted only their second live performanceTheir first album Crosby Stills  Nash 1969) was an immediate hit spawning two Top 40 hit singles and receiving key airplay on the new FM radio format in its early days populated by unfettered disc jockeys who then had the option of playing entire albums at onceThe songs Crosby wrote while in CSN include Guinnevere Almost Cut My Hair Long Time Gone and Delta. He also cowrote Wooden Ships with Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane and Stills.\nIn 1969, Neil Young joined the group and with him they recorded the album D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and the ARIA Charts. On September 30, 1969, Crosbys longtime girlfriend Christine Hinton was killed in a car accident only days after Hinton Crosby and Debbie Donovan moved from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area. Crosby was devastated and he began abusing drugs more severely than he had before. Nevertheless he still managed to contribute Almost Cut My Hair and the albums title track. After the release of the double live album 4 Way Street the group went on a fouryear hiatus to focus on their respective solo careersIn December 1969, Crosby appeared with CSNY at the Altamont Free Concert increasing his visibility after also having performed at the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock. At the beginning of 1970, he briefly joined with Jerry Garcia Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart from Grateful Dead billed as David and the Dorks and making a live recording at The Matrix on December 15, 1970.\nCSNY reunited in the summer of 1973 for unsuccessful recording sessions in Maui and Los Angeles. Despite lingering acrimony they reconvened at a Stills concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in October. This served as a prelude to their highly successful stadium tour in the summer of 1974. Following the tour the foursome attempted once again to record a new album provisionally entitled Human Highway. The recording sessions which took place at the Record Plant in Sausalito were very unpleasant marked by constant bickering. The acrimonious atmosphere was too much for Neil Young who deserted the sessions and the album was never completedIn rehearsals for the 1974 tour CSNY recorded a thenunreleased Crosby song Little Blind Fish. A different version of the song would appear on the second CPR album more than two decades later. The 1974 tour was also affected by bickering though they managed to finish it without interruption. A greatest hits compilation entitled So Far was released in 1974 to capitalize on the foursomes reunion tourIn 1976, as separate duos Crosby  Nash and Stills  Young were both working on respective albums and contemplated retooling their work to produce a CSNY album. This attempt ended bitterly as Stills and Young deleted Crosby and Nashs vocals from their album Long May You RunCSNY did not perform together again as a foursome until Live Aid in Philadelphia in 1985, and then performed only sporadically in the 1980s and 1990s mainly at the annual Bridge School Benefit organized by Youngs wife Pegi. Without Young however Crosby Stills  Nash performed much more consistently after its reformation in 1977. The trio toured in support of their 1977 and 1982 albums CSN and Daylight Again and then starting in the late 1980s toured regularly year after year. The group continued to perform live and since 1982 released four albums of new material American Dream 1988, with Young Live It Up 1990) After the Storm 1994) and Looking Forward 1999, with Young. In addition Crosby  Nash released the selftitled album Crosby  Nash in 2004.\nFullscale CSNY tours took place in 2000, 2002, and 2006.\n\nCrosby Stills and Nash appeared together on a 2008 episode of The Colbert Report with Colbert filling in for Young in the fourth harmony part on Teach Your Children.Following a November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future Nash announced on March 6, 2016, that Crosby Stills  Nash would never perform again because of his poor relationship with Crosby.\n\n1971\u20132022: Solo career and Crosby  Nash\nIn 1971, Crosby released his first solo album If I Could Only Remember My Name featuring contributions by Nash Young Joni Mitchell and members of Jefferson Airplane the Grateful Dead and Santana.

On May 13, 2020, Etheridge announced on her Twitter account that her and Cyphers son Beckett had died of causes related to opioid addiction at the age of 21.\n\nCannabis brand\nCrosby in partnership with longtime friend and entrepreneur Steven Sponder developed a craft cannabis brand called MIGHTY CROZ. Crosby a 50-plusyear cannabis advocate and connoisseur credited cannabis with contributing to his creative process of songwriting stating All those hit songs every one of them I wrote them all on cannabis. Crosby also credited cannabis and cannabidiol CBD with alleviating his chronic shoulder pain allowing him to continue touring and making new music well into his seventies. Crosby and Sponder intended to work with licensed cultivators throughout the US. and beyond and to also extend the brand to include CBD and hemp products. In 2018, Crosby was invited to join the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NORML advisory board.\n\nSailing\nHaving had a transformative sailing experience when he was eleven in 1967 Crosby purchased a 59-foot John Aldendesigned schooner named Mayan with his Byrds settlement. On Twitter in 2019, Crosby said that the late Peter Tork of the Monkees loaned him the money to buy the Mayan. In the decades before he sold the boat in 2014, Crosby sailed it thousands of miles in the Pacific and Caribbean. He credited the Mayan as being a songwriting muse he wrote some of his bestknown songs aboard the boat including Wooden Ships The Lee Shore Page 43, and Carry Me.\n\nPolitics\nCrosby was politically active throughout his professional career. He publicly questioned the report of the Warren Commission covering the assassination of John F. Kennedy onstage during the Byrdss appearance at the Monterey Festival in 1967, to the anger of his bandmates. He identified as a pacifist and was a wellknown opponent of US. participation in the Vietnam War although he defended the right to own gunsCrosby strongly criticized the presidency of Donald Trump declaring him to be a dangerous guy whos got a big ego. For the 2020 presidential election he said in an interview that Mayor Pete Buttigieg was his favorite candidate for president and was smarter than all the others combined however he eventually voted for Bernie SandersAlthough Crosby was against Joe Bidens candidacy during the 2020 presidential primaries he voiced a more positive assessment following Bidens general election victory in November. Describing him as a decent guy Crosby noted that the personal tragedies Biden experienced with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in 1972 and his oldest son Beau in 2015, made him a better human being. He has humanity and he has compassion for other human beings because hes seen a lot of rough stuff himself. I dont generally trust most politicians but I trust Biden to be who he is and I think hes going to do a good job. In May 2022, Crosby wrote in response to a prounion tweet from Biden that most Unions are useless and totally dishonest.\n\nActing career\nDuring the early 1990s Crosby appeared as a guest star in several episodes of The John Larroquette Show where he played the part of Larroquettes Alcoholics Anonymous AA sponsor. He appeared on a TV episode of Roseanne as the singerhusband of one of Roseannes coworkers who was played by Bonnie Bramlett. He sang the Danny Sheridan composition Roll On Down on that episode. He was on an episode of Ellen called Ellen Unplugged in which he was helping out at the Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. He also appeared as a pirate in the 1991 film Hook as a 1970s hippie in the 1991 film Backdraft and as a bartender in the 1992 film Thunderheart. Crosby also voiced himself on two episodes of The Simpsons Marge in Chains and Homers Barbershop Quartet.\n\nDrug alcohol and arrests\nCrosby spent nine months in a Texas state prison after being convicted of several drugs and weapons offenses in 1985. The drug charges were related to possession of heroin and cocaineLater in 1985, Crosby was arrested in California for drunken driving a hitandrun driving accident and possession of a concealed pistol and drug paraphernalia. He was arrested after driving into a fence in a Marin County suburb where officers found a .45-caliber pistol and cocaine in his carOn March 7, 2004, Crosby was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree illegal possession of a hunting knife illegal possession of ammunition and illegal possession of about one ounce of marijuana. He left the items behind in his New York City hotel room. Authorities said a hotel employee searched the suitcase for identification and found about an ounce of marijuana rolling papers two knives and a .45-caliber pistol. Mr. Crosby was arrested when he returned to the hotel to pick up his bag. After spending 12 hours in jail he was released on 3,500 bail. Crosby pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to attempted criminal possession of a weapon on July 4, 2004; he was fined 5,000 and received no jail time. Prosecutors did not seek a more severe penalty on the weapons charge because the pistol was registered in California and was stowed safely in his luggage when it was found. A charge of unlawful possession of marijuana was dismissed. Crosby was discharged by the court on condition that he pay his fine and not get arrested again.\n\nHealth issues and death\nCrosby was the recipient of a highly publicized liver\n transplant paid for by Phil Collins in 1994. News of his transplant led to public discussions because of his celebrity status and his previous problems with alcoholism and drug use. Crosbys liver problems stemmed from a long run with hepatitis CCrosby suffered from type 2 diabetes. During an October 2008 concert Crosby looking much thinner than in previous years announced to the audience that he had recently shed 55 pounds 25 kilograms as a result of his struggles with the diseaseIn February 2014, at the urging of his doctor Crosby postponed the final dates of his solo tour to undergo a cardiac catheterization and angiogram based on the results of a routine cardiac stress testCrosby died in Santa Ynez California on January 18, 2023, at the age of 81. Believing he was probably going to die fairly soon Crosby had planned his funeral at least three years prior to his death to be held at his horse ranch in Santa Ynez in hopes that he would be reconciled with his former Byrds and CSN bandmates so that they would attend. A statement from his family said that he died after a long illness. However friends and colleagues described his death as sudden saying that Crosby had remained active until the day of his death working on plans for a tour and a new album. Rumors circulated that his death was due to complications of COVID19.\nOn January 23, Stephen Stillss exwife V\u00e9ronique Sanson appeared on French television and stated that Crosby had died in his sleep from complications of COVID19.

Interview. David Crosby on love music and rancour Neil Young is probably the most selfish person I know. The Guardian.", "Bob Dylan legally Robert Dylan born Robert Allen Zimmerman May 24, 1941) is an American singersongwriter. Often considered to be one of the greatest songwriters in history Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60-year career. He rose to prominence in the 1960s when his songs Blowin in the Wind 1963) and The Times They Are aChangin 1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. Initially modeling his style on Woody Guthries folk songs Robert Johnsons blues and what he called the architectural forms of Hank Williamss country songs Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s infusing it with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry. His lyrics incorporated political social and philosophical influences defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning countercultureDylan was born and raised in St. Louis County Minnesota. Following his selftitled debut album of traditional folk songs in 1962, he made his breakthrough with The Freewheelin Bob Dylan the next year. The album features Blowin in the Wind and A Hard Rains aGonna Fall which like many of his early songs adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged The Times They Are aChangin and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964.  In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s Bringing It All Back Home Highway 61 Revisited both 1965) and Blonde on Blonde 1966). When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock the mix became more complex. His sixminute single Like a Rolling Stone 1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular musicIn July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylans withdrawal from touring. During this period he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Dylan explored country music and rural themes on John Wesley Harding 1967) Nashville Skyline 1969) and New Morning 1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s he became a bornagain Christian and released three albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rockbased idiom in the early 1980s. Dylans Time Out of Mind 1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since most recently Rough and Rowdy Ways 2020). He also recorded a trilogy of  albums covering the Great American Songbook especially songs sung by Frank Sinatra and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower Americana sensibility Shadow Kingdom 2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending TourSince 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 145 million records making him one of the bestselling musicians ever. He has received numerous awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom ten Grammy Awards a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded him a special citation for his profound impact on popular music and American culture marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power. In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\n\nLife and career\n1941\u20131959: Origins and musical beginnings\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman Hebrew \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham in St. Marys Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth Minnesota and raised in Hibbing Minnesota on the Mesabi Range west of Lake Superior. Dylans paternal grandparents Anna Kirghiz and Zigman Zimmerman emigrated from Odesa in the Russian Empire now Ukraine to the United States following the pogroms against Jews of 1905. His maternal grandparents Florence and Ben Stone were Lithuanian Jews who had arrived in the United States in 1902. Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmothers family was originally from the Ka\u011f\u0131zman district of Kars Province in northeastern TurkeyDylans father Abram Zimmerman and his mother Beatrice Beatty Stone were part of a small closeknit Jewish community. They lived in Duluth until Dylan was six when his father contracted polio and the family returned to his mothers hometown of Hibbing where they lived for the rest of Dylans childhood and his father and paternal uncles ran a furniture and appliance store. In his early years he listened to the radiofirst to blues and country stations from Shreveport Louisiana and later when he was a teenager to rock and rollDylan formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School. In the Golden Chords he performed covers of songs by Little Richard and Elvis Presley. Their performance of Danny  the Juniors Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone. In 1959, Dylans high school yearbook carried the caption Robert Zimmerman to join Little Richard. That year as Elston Gunnn he performed two dates with Bobby Vee playing piano and clapping. In September 1959, Dylan moved to Minneapolis to enroll at the University of Minnesota. Living at the Jewishcentric fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu house Dylan began to perform at the Ten OClock Scholar a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus and became involved in the Dinkytown folk music circuit. His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music as he explained in a 1985 interview\n\nThe thing about rocknroll is that for me anyway it wasnt enough ... There were great catchphrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs werent serious or didnt reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair more sadness more triumph more faith in the supernatural much deeper feelings.\nDuring this period he began to introduce himself as Bob Dylan. In his memoir he wrote that he considered adopting the surname Dillon before unexpectedly seeing poems by Dylan Thomas and deciding upon the given name spelling. Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview he said Youre born you know the wrong names wrong parents. I mean that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free.\n\n1960s\nRelocation to New York and record deal\nIn May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie who was seriously ill with Huntingtons disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. He wrote of Guthries impact The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them.. He was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthries greatest disciple. In addition to visiting Guthrie in hospital Dylan befriended his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ramblin Jack ElliottFrom February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village befriending and picking up material from folk singers including Dave Van Ronk Fred Neil Odetta the New Lost City Ramblers and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. In September The New York Times critic Robert Shelton boosted Dylans career with a very enthusiastic review of his performance at Gerdes Folk City Bob Dylan A Distinctive FolkSong Stylist. That month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hesters third album bringing him to the attention of the albums producer John Hammond who signed Dylan to Columbia Records. Dylans debut album Bob Dylan released March 19, 1962, consisted of traditional folk blues and gospel material with just two original compositions Talkin New York and Song to Woody. The album sold 5,000 copies in its first year just enough to break even.\n In August 1962, Dylan took two decisive steps in his career. He changed his name to Bob Dylan and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. Grossman remained Dylans manager until 1970, and was known for his sometimes confrontational personality and protective loyalty. Dylan said He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming. Tension between Grossman and John Hammond led to the latter suggesting Dylan work with the jazz producer Tom Wilson who produced several tracks for the second album without formal credit. Wilson produced the next three albums Dylan recordedDylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963. He had been invited by television director Philip Saville to appear in a drama Madhouse on Castle Street which Saville was directing for BBC Television. At the end of the play Dylan performed Blowin in the Wind one of its first public performances. While in London Dylan performed at London folk clubs including the Troubadour Les Cousins and Bunjies. He also learned material from UK performers including Martin CarthyBy the release of Dylans second album The Freewheelin Bob Dylan in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singersongwriter. Many songs on the album were labeled protest songs inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seegers passion for topical songs. Oxford Town was an account of James Merediths ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi. The first song on the album Blowin in the Wind partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song No More Auction Block while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for Peter Paul and Mary. A Hard Rains aGonna Fall was based on the folk ballad Lord Randall. With its apocalyptic premonitions the song gained resonance when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it. Like Blowin in the Wind A Hard Rains aGonna Fall marked a new direction in songwriting blending a streamofconsciousness imagist lyrical attack with traditional folk formDylans topical songs led to his being viewed as more than just a songwriter. Janet Maslin wrote of Freewheelin These were the songs that established Dylan as the voice of his generationsomeone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes. Freewheelin also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylans persona from the start and the range of material on the album impressed listeners including the Beatles. George Harrison said of the album We just played it just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitudeit was incredibly original and wonderful.The rough edge of Dylans singing unsettled some but attracted others. Author Joyce Carol Oates wrote When we first heard this raw very young and seemingly untrained voice frankly nasal as if sandpaper could sing the effect was dramatic and electrifying. Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers such as Joan Baez who became Dylans advocate and lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts. Others who had hits with Dylans songs in the early 1960s included the Byrds Sonny  Cher the Hollies the Association Manfred Mann and the Turtles.\nMixedUp Confusion recorded during the Freewheelin sessions with a backing band was released as Dylans first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound. Cameron Crowe described it as a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records.\n\nProtest and Another Side\nIn May 1963, Dylans political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals Dylan had been told by CBS televisions head of program practices that Talkin John Birch Paranoid Blues was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship Dylan refused to appearBy this time Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Dylans third album The Times They Are aChangin reflected a more politicized Dylan. The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories with Only a Pawn in Their Game addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers and the Brechtian The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger. Ballad of Hollis Brown and North Country Blues addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs Boots of Spanish Leather and One Too Many Mornings.By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements. Accepting the Tom Paine Award from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee characterized the members as old and balding and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedys assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.\nAnother Side of Bob Dylan recorded in a single evening on June 9, 1964, had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on I Shall Be Free No. 10\" and Motorpsycho Nightmare. Spanish Harlem Incident and To Ramona are passionate love songs while Black Crow Blues and I Dont Believe You She Acts Like We Never Have Met suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylans music. It Aint Me Babe on the surface a song about spurned love has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His new direction was signaled by two lengthy songs the impressionistic Chimes of Freedom which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as chains of flashing images and My Back Pages which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former championsIn the latter half of 1964 and into 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folkrock popmusic star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a Carnaby Street wardrobe sunglasses day or night and pointed Beatle boots. A London reporter noted Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo. Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Asked about a movie he planned while on Les Cranes television show he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy Dylan replied No I play my mother.\n\nGoing electric\nDylans late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap featuring his first recordings with electric instruments under producer Tom Wilsons guidance. The first single Subterranean Homesick Blues owed much to Chuck Berrys Too Much Monkey Business its freeassociation lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hiphop. The song was provided with an early music video which opened D. A. Pennebakers cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 presentation of Dylans 1965 tour of Great Britain Dont Look Back. Instead of miming Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylans idea and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisementsThe second side of Bringing It All Back Home contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. Mr. Tambourine Man became one of his bestknown songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK. Its All Over Now Baby Blue and Its Alright Ma Im Only Bleeding were two of Dylans most important compositionsIn 1965, headlining the Newport Folk Festival Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a pickup group featuring Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ. Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing unexpectedly with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner who filmed the performance said I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric. An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short setNevertheless Dylans performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment. In the September issue of Sing Out Ewan MacColl wrote Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ...But what of Bobby Dylan? scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely noncritical audience nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenthrate drivel. On July 29, four days after Newport Dylan was back in the studio in New York recording Positively 4th Street. The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia and have been interpreted as Dylans putdown of former friends from the folk community he had known in clubs along West 4th Street.\n\nHighway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde\nIn July 1965, Dylans sixminute single Like a Rolling Stone peaked at number two in the US chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one on The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Bruce Springsteen recalled first hearing the song that snare shot sounded like somebodyd kicked open the door to your mind. The song opened Dylans next album Highway 61 Revisited named after the road that led from Dylans Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans. The songs were in the same vein as the hit single flavored by Mike Bloomfields blues guitar and Al Koopers organ riffs. Desolation Row backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass offers the sole exception with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as an 11-minute epic of entropy which takes the form of a Felliniesque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters some historical Einstein Nero some biblical Noah Cain and Abel some fictional Ophelia Romeo Cinderella some literary T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and some who fit into none of the above categories notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse. Poet Philip Larkin who also reviewed jazz for The Daily Telegraph wrote Im afraid I poached Bob Dylans Highway 61 Revisited CBS out of curiosity and found myself well rewarded.\nIn support of the album Dylan was booked for two US concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm former members of Ronnie Hawkinss backing band the Hawks. On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylans electric sound. The bands reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorableFrom September 24, 1965, in Austin Texas Dylan toured the US and Canada for six months backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as The Band. While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences their studio efforts foundered. Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966, and surrounded him with topnotch session men. At Dylans insistence Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions. The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde 1966) featuring what Dylan called that thin wild mercury sound. Kooper described it as taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion the musical worlds of Nashville and of the quintessential New York hipster Bob DylanOn November 22, 1965, Dylan quietly married 25-yearold former model Sara Lownds. Some of Dylans friends including Ramblin Jack Elliott say that immediately after the event Dylan denied he was married. Writer Nora Ephron made the news public in the New York Post in February 1966 with the headline Hush! Bob Dylan is wed.Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. In the second backed by the Hawks he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans who jeered and slow handclapped. The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17, 1966. A recording of this concert was released in 1998: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966. At the climax of the evening a member of the audience angered by Dylans electric backing shouted Judas! to which Dylan responded I dont believe you ... Youre a liar! Dylan turned to his band and said Play it fucking loud! as they launched into the final song of the nightLike a Rolling Stone.\nDuring his 1966 tour Dylan was described as exhausted and acting as if on a death trip. D. A. Pennebaker the filmmaker accompanying the tour described Dylan as taking a lot of amphetamine and whoknowswhatelse. In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner Dylan said I was on the road for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs a lot of things ... just to keep going you know?\n\nMotorcycle accident and reclusion\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle a Triumph Tiger 100, near his home in Woodstock New York. Dylan said he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylans biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan concurred I had been in a motorcycle accident and Id been hurt but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race. He made very few public appearances and did not tour again for almost eight yearsOnce Dylan was well enough to resume creative work he began to edit D. A. Pennebakers film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television but they rejected it as incomprehensible to mainstream audiences. The film titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies has since been screened at a handful of film festivals. Secluded from public gaze Dylan recorded over 100 songs during 1967 at his Woodstock home and in the basement of the Hawks nearby house Big Pink. These songs were initially offered as demos for other artists to record and were first heard in the shape of hits for Julie Driscoll the Byrds and Manfred Mann. The public heard these recordings when Great White Wonder the first bootleg recording appeared in West Coast shops in July 1969, containing Dylan material recorded in Minneapolis in 1961 and seven Basement Tapes songs. This record gave birth to a minor industry in the illicit release of recordings by Dylan and other major rock artists. Columbia released a Basement selection in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.\nIn late 1967, Dylan returned to studio recording in Nashville accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass Kenny Buttrey on drums and Pete Drake on steel guitar. The result was John Wesley Harding a record of short songs thematically drawing on the American West and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation with lyrics that took the JudeoChristian tradition seriously was a departure from Dylans previous work. It included All Along the Watchtower famously covered by Jimi Hendrix. Woody Guthrie died in October 1967, and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20, 1968, where he was backed by the Band.\n\nNashville Skyline 1969) featured Nashville musicians a mellowvoiced Dylan a duet with Johnny Cash and the single Lay Lady Lay. Variety wrote Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range. During one recording session Dylan and Cash recorded a series of duets but only their version of Girl from the North Country appeared on the album. The album influenced the nascent genre of country rockIn 1969, Dylan was asked to write songs for Scratch Archibald MacLeishs musical adaptation of The Devil and Daniel Webster. MacLeish initially praised Dylans contributions writing to him Those songs of yours have been haunting me  and exciting me but creative differences led to Dylan leaving  the project. Some of the songs were later recorded by Dylan in a revised form. In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of The Johnny Cash Show where he sang a duet with Cash on Girl from the North Country and played solos of Living the Blues and I Threw It All Away. Dylan traveled to England to top the bill at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the Woodstock Festival closer to his home.\n\n1970s\nIn the early 1970s critics charged that Dylans output was varied and unpredictable. Greil Marcus asked What is this shit? upon first hearing Self Portrait released in June 1970. It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received. In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning considered a return to form. The title track was from Dylans illfated collaboration with MacLeish and Day of the Locusts was his account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970. In November 1968, Dylan cowrote Id Have You Anytime with George Harrison Harrison recorded that song and Dylans If Not for You for his album All Things Must Pass. Olivia NewtonJohn covered If Not For You on her  debut album and The Man in Me was prominently featured in the film The Big Lebowski 1998).\nTarantula a freeform book of prosepoetry had been written by Dylan during a creative burst in 1964-65, the period that produced Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Dylan shelved his book for several years apparently uncertain of its status until he suddenly informed Macmillan at the end of 1970 that the time had come to publish it. The book attracted negative reviews but later critics have suggested its affinities with Finnegans Wake and A Season In HellBetween March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock a small studio in Greenwich Village to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in Watching the River Flow and a new recording of When I Paint My Masterpiece. On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded George Jackson which he released a week later. For many the single was a surprising return to protest material mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year. Dylans surprise appearance at Harrisons Concert for Bangladesh on August 1, 1971, attracted media coverage as his live appearances had become rareIn 1972, Dylan joined Sam Peckinpahs film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid providing the soundtrack and playing Alias a member of Billys gang. Despite the films failure at the box office Knockin on Heavens Door became one of Dylans most covered songs. That same year Dylan protested the move to deport John Lennon and Yoko Ono who had been convicted for marijuana possession by sending a letter to the US Immigration Service which read in part Hurray for John  Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The countrys got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\n\nReturn to touring\nDylan began 1973 by signing with a new label David Geffens Asylum Records when his contract with Columbia Records expired. His next album Planet Waves was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour. The album included two versions of Forever Young which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it the song projected something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan and Dylan said I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental. Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan a collection of studio outtakes widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylans signing with a rival record labelIn January 1974, Dylan backed by the Band embarked on a North American tour of 40 concertshis first tour for seven years. A live double album Before the Flood was released on Asylum Records. Soon according to Clive Davis Columbia Records sent word they will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold. Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum unhappy that Geffen had sold only 600,000 copies of Planet Waves despite millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour he returned to Columbia Records which reissued his two Asylum albums.\n\nAfter the tour Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled three small notebooks with songs about relationships and ruptures and recorded the album Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the albums release and rerecorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother David Zimmerman. Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In NME Nick Kent described the accompaniments as often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes. In Rolling Stone Jon Landau wrote that the record has been made with typical shoddiness. Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylans masterpieces. In Salon journalist Bill Wyman wrote Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced the songs each of them are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrheaplagued excesses of his mid1960s output and the selfconsciously simple compositions of his postaccident years.\nIn the middle of 1975, Dylan championed boxer Rubin Hurricane Carter imprisoned for a triple murder in Paterson New Jersey with his ballad Hurricane making the case for Carters innocence. Despite its lengthover eight minutesthe song was released as a single peaking at 33 on the US Billboard chart and performed at every 1975 date of Dylans next tour the Rolling Thunder Revue. Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour featured about one hundred performers and supporters from the Greenwich Village folk scene among them Ramblin Jack Elliott TBone Burnett Joni Mitchell David Mansfield Roger McGuinn Mick Ronson Joan Baez and Scarlet Rivera whom Dylan discovered walking down the street her violin case on her back. The tour encompassed the January 1976 release of the album Desire. Many of Desires songs featuring a traveloguelike narrative style influenced by Dylans new collaborator playwright Jacques Levy. The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special Hard Rain and the LP Hard Rain.\n\nThe 1975 tour with the Revue provided the backdrop to Dylans film Renaldo and Clara a sprawling narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences. Actor and playwright Sam Shepard accompanied the Revue and was to serve as screenwriter but much of the film was improvised. Released in 1978, it received negative sometimes scathing reviews. Later in the year a twohour edit dominated by the concert performances was more widely released. In November 1976, Dylan appeared at the Bands farewell concert with Eric Clapton Muddy Waters Van Morrison Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Martin Scorseses 1978 film of the concert The Last Waltz included most of Dylans set.\nIn 1978, Dylan embarked on a yearlong world tour performing 114 shows in Japan the Far East Europe and North America to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eightpiece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album Bob Dylan at Budokan. Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C rating while Janet Maslin defended it These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals. When Dylan brought the tour to the US in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a Las Vegas Tour. The 1978 tour grossed more than 20 million and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because I had a couple of bad years. I put a lot of money into the movie built a big house  ... and it costs a lot to get divorced in California. In April and May 1978, Dylan took the same band and vocalists into Rundown Studios in Santa Monica California to record an album of new material StreetLegal. It was described by  Michael Gray as after Blood On The Tracks arguably Dylans best record of the 1970s a crucial album documenting a crucial period in Dylans own life. However it had poor sound and mixing attributed to Dylans studio practices muddying the instrumental detail until a remastered CD release in 1999 restored some of the songs strengths.\n\nChristian period\nIn the late 1970s Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity undertaking a threemonth discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches. He released three albums of contemporary gospel music. Slow Train Coming 1979) featured Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler and was produced by veteran RB producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied Bob youre dealing with a 62-yearold Jewish atheist. Lets just make an album. Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song Gotta Serve Somebody. When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older secular works and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage such as\n\nYears ago they ... said I was a prophet. I used to say No Im not a prophet they say Yes you are youre a prophet. I said No its not me. They used to say You sure are a prophet. They used to convince me I was a prophet. Now I come out and say Jesus Christ is the answer. They say Bob Dylans no prophet. They just cant handle it.\nDylans Christianity was unpopular with some fans and musicians. John Lennon shortly before being murdered recorded Serve Yourself in response to Gotta Serve Somebody. In 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that neither age hes now 40) nor his muchpublicized conversion to bornagain Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament.\n\n1980s\nIn late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as A Musical Retrospective restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. His second Christian album Saved 1980) received mixed reviews described by Michael Gray as the nearest thing to a followup album Dylan has ever made Slow Train Coming II and inferior. His third Christian album was Shot of Love 1981). The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years mixed with Christian songs. The lyrics of Every Grain of Sand recall William Blakes Auguries of Innocence. Elvis Costello wrote that Shot of Love may not be your favorite Bob Dylan record but it might contain his best song Every Grain of Sand.\nReception of Dylans  1980s recordings varied. Gray criticized Dylans 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs. Infidels 1983) employed Knopfler again as lead guitarist  and also as producer the sessions resulted in several songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were Blind Willie McTell which was both a tribute to the eponymous blues musician and an evocation of African American history Foot of Pride and Lord Protect My Child. These three songs were later released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 Rare  Unreleased 1961\u20131991Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire Burlesque. Arthur Baker who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and Cyndi Lauper was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylans album sound a little bit more contemporary. In 1985 Dylan sang on USA for Africas famine relief single We Are the World. He also joined Artists United Against Apartheid providing vocals for their single Sun City. On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood he performed a ragged version of Ballad of Hollis Brown a tale of rural poverty and then said to the worldwide audience I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it maybe ... one or two million maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and the farmers here owe to the banks. His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate but inspired Willie Nelson to organize a concert Farm Aid to benefit debtridden American farmersIn October 1985, Dylan released  Biograph a box set featuring 53 tracks 18 of them previously unreleased. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote Historically Biograph is significant not for what it did for Dylans career but for establishing the box set complete with hits and rarities as a viable part of rock history Biograph also contained liner notes by Cameron Crowe in which Dylan discussed the origins of some of his songsIn April 1986, Dylan made a foray into rap when he added vocals to the opening verse of Street Rock on Kurtis Blows album Kingdom Blow. Dylans next studio album Knocked Out Loaded 1986) contained three covers by Junior Parker Kris Kristofferson and the gospel hymn Precious Memories plus three collaborations with Tom Petty Sam Shepard and Carole Bayer Sager and two solo compositions by Dylan. A reviewer wrote that the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records werent entirely unexpected by Dylan but that didnt make them any less frustrating. It was the first Dylan album since his 1962 debut to fail to make the Top 50. Some critics have called the song Dylan cowrote with Shepard Brownsville Girl a masterpieceIn 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the Grateful Dead in 1987, resulting in the live album Dylan  The Dead which received negative reviews Erlewine said it was quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead. Dylan initiated what came to be called the Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a backup band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith. Dylan would continue to tour with a small changing band for the next 30 years. In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquands movie Hearts of Fire in which he played Billy Parker a washedup rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover Fiona leaves him for a jaded English synthpop sensation Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrackNight After Night and Had a Dream About You Baby as well as a cover of John Hiatts The Usual. The film was a critical and commercial flop.\nDylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988. Bruce Springsteen in his introduction declared Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was antiintellectual. Down in the Groove 1988) sold even more poorly than Knocked Out Loaded. Gray wrote The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant. The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys a supergroup Dylan cofounded with George Harrison Jeff Lynne Roy Orbison and Tom Petty. In late 1988, their Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached number three on the US albums chart featuring songs described as Dylans most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbisons death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990, Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Gray praised the album as Attentively written vocally distinctive musically warm and uncompromisingly professional this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s. Most of the Time a lostlove composition was prominently featured in the film High Fidelity 2000) while What Was It You Wanted has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of Ring Them Bells struck some critics as a reaffirmation of faith.\n\n1990s\nDylans 1990s began with Under the Red Sky 1990) an aboutface from the serious Oh Mercy. It contained several apparently simple songs including Under the Red Sky and Wiggle Wiggle. The album was dedicated to Gabby Goo Goo a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis Desiree Gabrielle DennisDylan who was four. Musicians on the album included George Harrison Slash David Crosby Bruce Hornsby Stevie Ray Vaughan and Elton John. The record received negative reviews and sold poorly. In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily impairing his performances on stage. In an interview with Rolling Stone Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music Thats completely inaccurate. I can drink or not drink. I dont know why people would associate drinking with anything I do really.Defilement and remorse were themes Dylan addressed when he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from Jack Nicholson in February 1991. The event coincided with the start of the Gulf War and Dylan played Masters of War Rolling Stone called his performance almost unintelligible. He made a short speech My daddy once said to me he said Son it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways. This was a paraphrase of 19thcentury Orthodox Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirschs commentary on Psalm 27. On October 16, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of Dylans debut album was celebrated with a concert at Madison Square Garden christened Bobfest by Neil Young and featuring John Mellencamp Stevie Wonder Lou Reed Eddie Vedder Dylan and others. It was recorded as the live album The 30th Anniversary Concert CelebrationOver the next few years Dylan returned to his roots with two albums covering traditional folk and blues songs Good as I Been to You 1992) and World Gone Wrong 1993) backed solely by his acoustic guitar. Many critics and fans noted the quiet beauty of the song Lone Pilgrim written by a 19thcentury teacher. In August 1994, he played at Woodstock 94; Rolling Stone called his performance triumphant.  In November Dylan recorded two live shows for MTV Unplugged. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by Sony executives who insisted on hits. The resulting album MTV Unplugged included John Brown an unreleased 1962 song about how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.\nWith a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miamis Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were by some accounts fraught with musical tension. Before the albums release Dylan was hospitalized with a lifethreatening heart infection pericarditis brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was canceled but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying I really thought Id be seeing Elvis soon. He was back on the road by midyear and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 to a homily based on Dylans Blowin in the Wind.In September Dylan released the new Lanoisproduced album Time Out of Mind. With its bitter assessments of love and morbid ruminations Dylans first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed.  Alex Ross called it a thrilling return to form. Cold Irons Bound won Dylan another Grammy For Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and the album won him his first Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The albums first single Not Dark Yet has been called one of Dylans best songs and Make You Feel My Love was covered by Billy Joel Garth Brooks Adele and others. Elvis Costello said I think it might be the best record hes made.\n\n2000s\nIn 2001, Dylan won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Things Have Changed written for the film Wonder Boys. Love and Theft was released on September 11, 2001. Recorded with his touring band Dylan produced the album under the alias Jack Frost. Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly Western swing jazz and lounge music. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Controversy ensued when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the albums lyrics and Junichi Sagas book Confessions of a Yakuza.  Saga was not familiar with Dylans work but said he was flattered. Upon hearing the album Saga said of Dylan His lines flow from one image to the next and dont always make sense. But they have a great atmosphere.In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his Christian period and participated in the project Gotta Serve Somebody The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan. That year Dylan released Masked  Anonymous which he cowrote with director Larry Charles under the alias Sergei Petrov. Dylan starred as Jack Fate alongside a cast that included Jeff Bridges Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and John Goodman. The film polarized critics. In The New York Times A. O. Scott called it as an incoherent mess a few treated it as a serious work of artIn 2004, Dylan published the first part of his memoir Chronicles Volume One. Confounding expectations Dylan devoted three chapters to his first year in New York City in 1961\u20131962, virtually ignoring the mid1960s when his fame was at its height while devoting chapters to the albums New Morning 1970) and Oh Mercy 1989). The book reached number two on The New York Times Hardcover NonFiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a National Book AwardMartin Scorseses Dylan documentary No Direction Home was broadcast on September 26\u201327, 2005, on BBC Two in the UK and as part of American Masters on PBS in the US. It covers the period from Dylans arrival in New York in 1961 to his motorcycle crash in 1966, featuring interviews with Suze Rotolo Liam Clancy Joan Baez Allen Ginsberg Pete Seeger Mavis Staples and Dylan himself. The film earned a Peabody Award and a ColumbiaduPont Award. The accompanying soundtrack featured unreleased songs from Dylans early years.\n\nModern Times\nDylans career as a radio presenter began on May 3, 2006, with his weekly program Theme Time Radio Hour on XM Satellite Radio. He played songs with a common theme such as Weather Weddings Dance and Dreams. Dylans records ranged from Muddy Waters to Prince LL. Cool J to the Streets. Dylans show was praised for the breadth of his musical selections and for his jokes stories and eclectic references. In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series the theme was Goodbye and he signed off with Woody Guthries So Long Its Been Good to Know Yuh.\nDylan released Modern Times in August 2006. Despite some coarsening of Dylans voice a critic for The Guardian characterized his singing on the album as a catarrhal death rattle most reviewers praised the album and many described it as the final installment of a successful trilogy encompassing Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft. Modern Times entered the US charts at number one making it Dylans first album to reach that position since 1976's Desire. The New York Times published an article exploring similarities between some of Dylans lyrics in Modern Times and the work of the Civil War poet Henry Timrod. Modern Times won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Dylan won Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for Someday Baby. Modern Times was named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone and Uncut. On the same day that Modern Times was released the iTunes Music Store released Bob Dylan The Collection a digital box set containing all of his albums 773 tracks in total along with 42 rare and unreleased tracks.\nOn October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective Dylan anthologizing his entire career under the Dylan 07 logo. The sophistication of the Dylan 07 marketing campaign was a reminder that Dylans commercial profile had risen considerably since the 1990s. This became evident in 2004, when Dylan appeared in a TV advertisement for Victorias Secret lingerie. Three years later in October 2007, he participated in a multimedia campaign for the 2008 Cadillac Escalade. In 2009 he gave the highest profile endorsement of his career to date appearing with rapper william in a Pepsi ad that debuted during the telecast of Super Bowl XLIII. The ad opened with Dylan singing the first verse of Forever Young followed by william doing a hip hop version of the songs third and final verseThe Bootleg Series Vol. 8  Tell Tale Signs was released in October 2008, as both a twoCD set and a threeCD version with a 150-page hardcover book. The set contains live performances and outtakes from selected studio albums from Oh Mercy to Modern Times as well as soundtrack contributions and collaborations with David Bromberg and Ralph Stanley. The pricing of the albumthe twoCD set went on sale for 1899 and the threeCD version for 12999\u2014led to complaints about ripoff packaging from some fans and commentators. The release was widely acclaimed by critics. The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes feels like a new Bob Dylan record not only for the astonishing freshness of the material but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here.\n\nTogether Through Life and Christmas in the Heart\nDylan released Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan Dylan explained it originated when French director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his movie My Own Love Song. He initially intended to record a single track Life Is Hard but the record sort of took its own direction. Nine of the albums ten songs are credited as cowritten by Dylan and Robert Hunter. The album received largely favorable reviews although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylans canon. In its first week of release the album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the US making Dylan at 67 years of age the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chartDylans Christmas in the Heart was released in October 2009, comprising such Christmas standards as Little Drummer Boy Winter Wonderland and Here Comes Santa Claus. Edna Gundersen wrote that Dylan was revisiting yuletide styles popularized by Nat King Cole Mel Torm\u00e9 and the Ray Conniff Singers. Dylans royalties from the album were donated to the charities Feeding America in the USA Crisis in the UK and the World Food Programme. The album received generally favorable reviews. In an interview published in The Big Issue Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style and he replied There wasnt any other way to play it. These songs are part of my life just like folk songs. You have to play them straight too.\n\n2010s\nTempest\nVolume 9 of Dylans Bootleg Series The Witmark Demos was issued in October 18, 2010. It comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylans earliest music publishers Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964. One reviewer described the set as a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business and the world one note at a time. On the critical aggregator Metacritic the album has a score of 86, indicating universal acclaim. In the same week Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan The Original Mono Recordings a box set that presented Dylans eight earliest albums from Bob Dylan 1962) to John Wesley Harding 1967) in their original mono mix in the CD format for the first time. The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by Greil MarcusOn April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert  Brandeis University 1963, taped at Brandeis University on May 10, 1963, two weeks before the release of The Freewheelin Bob Dylan. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray who says it captures Dylan from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadnt yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period ... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star.\nOn Dylans 70th birthday three universities organized symposia on his work the University of Mainz the University of Vienna and the University of Bristol invited literary critics and cultural historians to give papers on aspects of Dylans work. Other events including tribute bands discussions and simple singalongs took place around the world as reported in The Guardian From Moscow to Madrid Norway to Northampton and Malaysia to his home state of Minnesota selfconfessed Bobcats will gather today to celebrate the 70th birthday of a giant of popular music.Dylans 35th studio album Tempest was released on September 11, 2012. The album features a tribute to John Lennon Roll On John and the title track is a 14-minute song about the sinking of the Titanic. In Rolling Stone Will Hermes gave Tempest five out of five stars writing Lyrically Dylan is at the top of his game joking around dropping wordplay and allegories that evade pat readings and quoting other folks words like a freestyle rapper on fire.Volume 10 of Dylans Bootleg Series Another Self Portrait 1969\u20131971) was released in August 2013. The album contained 35 previously unreleased tracks including alternative takes and demos from Dylans 1969\u20131971 recording sessions during the making of the Self Portrait and New Morning albums. The box set also included a live recording of Dylans performance with the Band at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1969. Thom Jurek wrote For fans this is more than a curiosity its an indispensable addition to the catalog. Columbia Records released a boxed set containing all 35 Dylan studio albums six albums of live recordings and a collection of nonalbum material Sidetracks as Bob Dylan Complete Album Collection Vol. One in November 2013. To publicize the box set an innovative video of Like a Rolling Stone was released on Dylans website. The interactive video created by director Vania Heymann allowed viewers to switch between 16 simulated TV channels all featuring characters who are lipsynching the lyricsDylan appeared in a commercial for the Chrysler 200 car which aired during the 2014 Super Bowl. In it he says that Detroit made cars and cars made America. He concludes So let Germany brew your beer let Switzerland make your watch let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car.

The book was edited by literary critic Christopher Ricks Julie Nemrow and Lisa Nemrow and offered variant versions of Dylans songs sourced from outtakes and live performances.

All of the songs on the album had been recorded by Frank Sinatra but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of Sinatra covers. Dylan explained I dont see myself as covering these songs in any way. Theyve been covered enough. Buried as a matter a fact. What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them. Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day. Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylans singing. The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965\u20131966, consisting of previously unreleased material from the three albums Dylan recorded between January 1965 and March 1966 Bringing It All Back Home Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde was released in November 2015.

On Dylans website the Collectors Edition was described as containing every single note recorded by Bob Dylan in the studio in 1965/1966\". The Best of the Cutting Edge entered the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart at number one on November 18, based on its firstweek salesDylan released Fallen Angels described as a direct continuation of the work of uncovering the Great Songbook that he began on  Shadows In the Night in May. The album contained twelve songs by classic songwriters such as Harold Arlen Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mercer eleven of which had been recorded by Sinatra. Jim Farber wrote in Entertainment Weekly Tellingly Dylan delivers these songs of love lost and cherished not with a burning passion but with the wistfulness of experience. Theyre memory songs now intoned with a present sense of commitment. Released just four days ahead of his 75th birthday they couldnt be more ageappropriate. The 1966 Live Recordings including every known recording of Dylans 1966 concert tour was released in November 2016. The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27.

Dylans 38th studio album was recorded in Hollywoods Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. Nostalgic? No I wouldnt say that. Its not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of whats no more. A song like Sentimental Journey is not a way back when song it doesnt emulate the past its attainable and down to earth its in the here and now. Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylans exploration of the Great American Songbook though in the opinion of Uncut For all its easy charms Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums worth of croon toons this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter.The next volume of Dylans Bootleg Series revisited his Born Again Christian period of 1979 to 1981, described by Rolling Stone as an intense wildly controversial time that produced three albums and some of the most confrontational concerts of his long career. Reviewing the box set The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979\u20131981, comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times Decades later what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylans unmistakable fervor his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued even tentative compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylans voice is clear cutting and ever improvisational working the crowds he was emphatic committed sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music. Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylans gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon. \nIn April 2018, Dylan made a contribution to the compilation EP Universal Love a collection of reimagined wedding songs for the LGBT community.

By April 2019, Dylan and his band had played more than 3,000 shows anchored by longtime bassist Tony Garnier and multiinstrumentalist Donnie HerronTo the dismay of some of his audience Dylans performances were unpredictable as he often altered his arrangements and changed his vocal approach. These variable performances divided critics. Richard Williams and Andy Gill argued that Dylan had found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others criticized his live performances for changing the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable and giving so little to the audience that it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all.In September 2021, Dylans touring company announced a series of tours which were billed as the Rough and Rowdy Ways World Wide Tour 2021\u20132024\".

On hearing Dylan perform his song With God on Our Side Baez later said I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad. In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival setting the scene for similar duets over the next two years. By the time of Dylans 1965 tour of the UK their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out as captured in D. A. Pennebakers documentary film Dont Look Back.

Ive always thought theres a superior power that this is not the real world and that theres a world to come. In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek\n\nHeres the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flatout truth I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I dont find it anywhere else. Songs like Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain or I Saw the Lightthats my religion. I dont adhere to rabbis preachers evangelists all of that. Ive learned more from the songs than Ive learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.\nDylan has supported the Chabad Lubavitch movement and has privately participated in Jewish religious events including his sons Bar Mitzvahs and services at Hadar Hatorah a Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva.

The award was controversial and The New York Times reported Mr. Dylan 75, is the first musician to win the award and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901. Dylan remained silent for days after receiving the award and then told journalist Edna Gundersen that winning the award was amazing incredible. Whoever dreams about something like that? Dylans Nobel Lecture was posted on the Nobel Prize website on June 5, 2017. Horace Engdahl a member of the Nobel Committee described Dylans place in literary historya singer worthy of a place beside the Greek bards beside Ovid beside the Romantic visionaries beside the kings and queens of the blues beside the forgotten masters of brilliant standards.\n\nLegacy\nDylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century where he was called master poet caustic social critic and intrepid guiding spirit of the counterculture generation.Paul Simon suggested that Dylans early compositions virtually took over the folk genre Dylans early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies. Blowin in the Wind has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while.For many critics his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid1960s trilogy of albumsBringing It All Back Home Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. In Mike Marqusees words\n\nBetween late 1964 and the middle of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk blues country RB rocknroll gospel British beat symbolist modernist and Beat poetry surrealism and Dada advertising jargon and social commentary Fellini and Mad magazine he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console.\nDylans lyrics began to receive critical study as early as 1998, when Stanford University sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan held in the United States. In 2004, Richard F. Thomas Classics professor at Harvard University created a freshman seminar titled Dylan which aimed to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last halfcentury but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer. Thomas went on to publish Why Bob Dylan Matters exploring Dylans connections with GrecoRoman literature. Literary critic Christopher Ricks published Dylans Visions of Sin an appreciation of Dylans work. Following Dylans Nobel win Ricks reflected Id not have written a book about Dylan to stand alongside my books on Milton and Keats Tennyson and TS. Eliot if I didnt think Dylan a genius of and with language. The critical consensus that Dylans songwriting was his outstanding creative achievement was articulated by Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Hailed as the Shakespeare of his generation Dylan ... set the standard for lyric writing.  Former British poet laureate Andrew Motion said Dylans lyrics should be studied in schools. His lyrics have entered the vernacular Edna Gundersen notes thatLines that branded Dylan a poet and counterculture valedictorian in the 60s are imprinted on the culture When you got nothing you got nothing to lose a hard rains agonna fall to live outside the law you must be honest. Some lyrics  you dont need a weather man to know which way the wind blows and the times they are achangin   appear in Bartletts Familiar Quotations.\nRolling Stone ranked Dylan first on its 2015 list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time fifteenth on its 2023 list of the Greatest Singers of All Time and placed Like A Rolling Stone first on their  list of greatest songs in 2004 and 2011. He was listed second on the magazines  list of the hundred greatest artists. The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock  Roll writes that His lyricsthe first in rock to be seriously regarded as literaturebecame so well known that politicians from Jimmy Carter to V\u00e1clav Havel have cited them as an influence.\nDylans voice also received critical attention. Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as a rusty voice suggesting Guthries old performances etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronks. His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rocknroll backing bands Michael Gray described the sound of Dylans vocal work on Like a Rolling Stone as at once young and jeeringly cynical. As Dylans voice aged during the 1980s for some critics it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition Dylans more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songsthis voice carries us across the landscape of a broken fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in Everything is Broken on the album Oh Mercy is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.\nAmong musicians who have acknowledged his influence are John Lennon Paul McCartney Jerry Garcia Pete Townshend Syd Barrett Joni Mitchell Neil Young Bruce Springsteen David Bowie Bryan Ferry Patti Smith Joe Strummer Bono Nick Cave Leonard Cohen Tom Waits and Chuck D.\nDylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of Mr. Tambourine Man and the subsequent album while the Band were Dylans backing band on his 1966 tour recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967 and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut albumJohnny Cash introducing Wanted Man said I dont have to tell you who Bob Dylan isthe greatest writer of our time.Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom Nik Cohn objected I cant take the vision of Dylan as seer as teenage messiah as everything else hes been worshipped as. The way I see him hes a minor talent with a major gift for selfhype. Australian critic Jack Marx credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant fauxcerebral posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem educating themselves from the Dylan handbook.Fellow musicians have also expressed critical views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a plagiarist and his voice as fake in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times. Mitchells comments led to discussions on Dylans use of other peoples material both supporting and criticizing him. Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism including his use of Henry Timrods verse in his album Modern Times by saying that it was part of the tradition.Dylans music has inspired artists in other fields. Dave Gibbons recalls how he and Alan Moore were inspired by the lines of Desolation Row beginning At midnight all the agents And the superhuman crew.. It was a glimpse a mere fragment of something something ominous paranoid and threatening. But something that showed that comics like poetry or rock and roll or Bob Dylan himself might feasibly become part of the greater cultural continuum. The lines must have also lodged in Alans consciousness for nearly twenty years later Dylans words eventually provided the title of the first issue of our comic book series Watchmen. Gibbons says of their seminal comic It began with Bob Dylan.In 2007, Todd Haynes released Im Not There inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan. The movie used six actors Christian Bale Cate Blanchett Marcus Carl Franklin  Richard Gere Heath Ledger and Ben Whishaw to explore different facets of Dylans life.

Irish playwright Conor McPherson wrote and directed the musical Girl From the North Country which used Dylans songs to tell the stories of various characters during the Depression years set in Dylans hometown of Duluth Minnesota. The play premiered in London in 2017If Dylans work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. In his review of  Im Not There J. Hoberman wrote\n\nElvis might never have been born but someone else would surely have brought the world rock n roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a wouldbe Elvis from Hibbing Minnesota would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the worlds first and greatest rock n roll beatnik bard and thenhaving achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoningvanish into a folk tradition of his own making.\n\nArchives and honors\nThe sale of Dylans archive of about 6,000 items of memorabilia to the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa was announced on March 2, 2016.

An exhibition of Dylans art The Asia Series opened at the Gagosian Madison Avenue Gallery on September 20, displaying Dylans paintings of scenes in China and the Far East. The New York Times reported that some fans and Dylanologists have raised questions about whether some of these paintings are based on the singers own experiences and observations or on photographs that are widely available and were not taken by Mr. Dylan. The Times pointed to close resemblances between Dylans paintings and historic photos of Japan and China and photos taken by Dmitri Kessel and Henri CartierBresson. Art critic Blake Gopnik has defended Dylans artistic practice arguing Ever since the birth of photography painters have used it as the basis for their works Edgar Degas and \u00c9douard Vuillard and other favorite artistseven Edvard Munchall took or used photos as sources for their art sometimes barely altering them. The Magnum photo agency confirmed that Dylan had licensed the reproduction rights of these photographsDylans second show at the Gagosian Gallery Revisionist Art opened in November 2012.

In a statement released by the gallery Dylan said Ive been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.In November 2016, the Halcyon Gallery featured a collection of drawings watercolors and acrylic works by Dylan.

In a 2017 interview Earle said about President Donald Trump Weve never had an orangutan in the White House before. Theres a lot of What does this button do? going on. Its scary. He really is a fascist. Whether he intended to be or not hes a real live fascist. However Earle has called for the American left to engage with the concerns of working class Trump voters saying in 2017: maybe thats one of the things we need to examine from my side because were responsible. The left has lost touch with American people and its time to discuss that. In 2020, he stated I thought that given the way things are now it was maybe my responsibility to make a record that spoke to and for people who didnt vote the way that I did. One of the dangers that were in is if people like me keep thinking that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist or an asshole then were fucked because its simply not true.In his 1990 song Justice in Ontario Earle sang about the Port Hope 8 case. Earle criticized the conviction of six Satans Choice bikers for a 1978 murder in Port Hope arguing that the accused were innocent framed by the ruthless Corporal Terry Hall of the Ontario Provincial Polices Special Squad.

In 1990, Earle stated in an interview about Justice in Ontario Theres some concern about reprisals because the OPP. Ontario Provincial Police is obviously not gonna be thrilled. My hope is that Ill be far too outintheopen and far too public for the police to do anything and get away with it. But the point is thats not a reason for doing or not doing anything becauseI very nearly went to prison myself for something I didnt do simply because a law enforcement agency didnt want to admit that somebody had fucked upthey didnt want to open the whole can of worms and all the other complaints that were constantly brought against the Dallas police department. You cant stand by and let stuff like that go down without saying anything about it. And I think I especially have a responsibility to do that cause if I didnt have any money right now Id be in prison in TexasIm convinced of that. It was that close. But I was able to afford decent legal representation. And it comes down to the fact that people who cant afford decent legal representationwho are subject to something like this happening and turning out very badlyfeed my kids. Thats where my money comes from and thats where my freedom comes from.Earle is a vocal opponent of capital punishment which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several of his songs have provided descriptions of the experiences of death row inmates including Billy Austin and Over Yonder Jonathans Song. Conversely he has also written a song from the perspective of a prison guard working on death row in Ellis Unit One a song written for the film Dead Man Walking the title based on the name of the State of Texas mens death row. He is prochoice and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions he says the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access.

Wade who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women. Since his youngest son was diagnosed with autism Earle has also become an advocate for people on the autism spectrum.\n\nDiscography\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSchone Mark. 1998). Steve Earle.

He became involved in the Los Angeles punk rock scene. At age nine he became fixated on the Germs repeatedly listening to their album GI. He would later use a nonstandard tuning of his own invention to play songs from the album singlefinger barreFrusciante began studying guitarists such as Jeff Beck Jimmy Page David Gilmour and Jimi Hendrix at 11. He discovered Frank Zappa whose work he would study for hours. He dropped out of high school at age 16 with the permission of his parents and upon completion of a proficiency test. With their support he moved to Los Angeles to develop his musicianship. He began taking classes at the Guitar Institute of Technology but turned to punching in without actually attending and left shortly thereafter.\n\nCareer\n1988\u20131992: First term with the Red Hot Chili Peppers\nFrusciante discovered the Red Hot Chili Peppers around 1984 when his guitar instructor was auditioning as a guitarist for them. Frusciante attended a Red Hot Chili Peppers performance at age 15 and rapidly became a devoted fan. He idolized their guitarist Hillel Slovak familiarizing himself with virtually all the guitar and bass parts from the Red Hot Chili Peppers first few records. He became acquainted with Slovak and the two spoke months before Slovaks death. Frusciante told him he would not like the band if they became popular enough to play the Forum Inglewood and preferred smaller audiencesFrusciante became friends with the former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They jammed together and Peligro invited his friend the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. Frusciante and Flea had an immediate musical chemistry. Around the same time Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa but changed his mind as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said I realized that I wanted to be a rock star do drugs and get girls and that I wouldnt be able to do that if I was in Zappas band.Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988. Devastated the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons left the group. The remaining members Flea and the vocalist Anthony Kiedis recruited Peligro on drums and DeWayne Blackbyrd McKnight formerly of ParliamentFunkadelic on guitar. However McKnight failed to connect musically with the group. Flea proposed auditioning Frusciante whose intimate knowledge of the Red Hot Chili Peppers repertoire impressed him. Flea and Kiedis auditioned him and agreed that he would be a suitable replacement for McKnight. When Flea called Frusciante with the news of his acceptance Frusciante ran through his house screaming with joy and jumped on a wall leaving permanent boot marks. He turned down a contract with Thelonious Monster with whom he had been playing for two weeks to accept the Chili Peppers offerFrusciante was not familiar with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers sound saying I wasnt really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillels playing and I just took it sideways from there. Several weeks after Frusciante joined Peligro whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse was fired. Chad Smith was recruited as the drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album Mothers Milk 1989). Frusciante focused on emulating Slovaks style. The producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed with this approach and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone largely absent from the bands three preceding records. Frusciante and Beinhorn frequently fought over guitar tone and layering Beinhorn prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by his knowledge of the studio. Kiedis recalled that Beinhorn wanted John to have a big crunching almost metalsounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acidrock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky sexy funky guitar tones.The Chili Peppers collaborated with the producer Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante Blood Sugar Sex Magik 1991). Rubin felt that it was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting and suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion. Frusciante Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside and spent most of their time smoking marijuana. Around this time Frusciante began a side project with Flea and the Janes Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins the Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly 10 to 15 hours of material which went unreleased.\n\n1992: First departure from the Chili Peppers\nBlood Sugar Sex Magik reached number three on the Billboard charts and went on to sell 13 million copies worldwide. The unexpected success turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame and struggled to cope. Soon after the albums release he began to develop a dislike for the bands popularity. He and Kiedis argued after concerts John would say Were too popular. I dont need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago. Frusciante later said that the bands rise to popularity was too high too far too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldnt cope with it.Frusciante also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers began their world tour he started to hear voices in his head telling him you wont make it during the tour you have to go now. Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism however by the age of 20, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out I had to be extrahumble extraantirock star. He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyos Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform but left for California the next morning. It was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer he said. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular but just the direction it was going. He was replaced by former Janes Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.\nIn a 2015 interview Cris Kirkwood said that following Frusciantes departure from the band in 1992, Frusciante auditioned for the Meat Puppets. Kirkwood said He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot. We were on a major label then we just got signed and those guys had blown up to where they were at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said You want to use my tuner? He said No Ill bend it in. It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didnt come to anything. Maybe he wasnt in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didnt quite happen but it could have worked.\n\n1992\u20131997: Addiction and first solo albums\nFrusciante had developed serious drug habits while touring with the Chili Peppers he said that when he found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show that inspired me to be a pothead. He used heroin and was on the verge of fullscale addiction. Upon returning to California in 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play the guitar. He spent the next three years in his Hollywood Hills home the walls of which were badly damaged and covered in graffiti. During this time his friends Johnny Depp and Gibby Haynes went to his house and filmed a documentary short Stuff depicting the squalor in which he was living. The house was eventually destroyed by a fire that also destroyed Frusciantes vintage guitar collection and several recordingsFrusciante focused on painting producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a lifethreatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision I was very sad and I was always happy when I was on drugs therefore I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guiltyI was always really proud to be an addict.\n\nIn 1993, Frusciante briefly performed with the band P alongside Depp the Butthole Surfers frontman Gibby Haynes the actor Sal Jenco and the songwriter Bill Carter. The band often played gigs at the Viper Room including a performance with Flea on October 30, 1993. According to Gibby Haynes the band was performing their song Michael Stipe when outside the venue River Phoenix was having seizures on the sidewalk. Phoenix died in the early hours of October 31 of heart failure brought on by an overdose of cocaine and heroin at the age of 23. In his book Running with Monsters Bob Forrest wrote that River Phoenix and Frusciante spent the days preceding Phoenixs death together on a drug binge consuming cocaine and heroin without sleeping for daysFrusciante released his first solo album Niandra Lades and Usually Just a TShirt in 1994. Frusciante denied that it was recorded while he was on heroin saying it was released when he was a heroin addict. The album is an avantgarde composition whose initial purpose was a spiritual and emotional expression I wrote the record because I was in a really big place in my headit was a huge spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as Im obeying those forces its always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say Play something that sucks and if Im in that place its gonna be great. And it has nothing to do with me except in ways that cant be understood. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a TShirt was released on Rick Rubins label American Recordings. Warner Bros the Red Hot Chili Peppers label owned rights to the album because of the leavingartist clause in Frusciantes band contract. However because he was reclusive the label handed the rights over to Rubin who released the album at the urging of Frusciantes friendsA 1996 article in the New Times LA described Frusciante as a skeleton covered in thin skin who weighed little more than forty kilograms eightyeight pounds at the nadir of his addictions and nearly died from a blood infection. His arms were fiercely scarred from selfharming as well as improperly shooting heroin and cocaine leaving permanent abscesses. Frusciante released his second solo album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997. The albums first track Enter a Uh is characterized by cryptic lyrics and hysterical screeches. Frusciante also coughs throughout the track showcasing his deteriorating health.  The album features Phoenix on Height Down. Frusciante said he released the album to get drug money and withdrew it from the market in 1999.\n\n1998\u20132002: Rehabilitation and return to the Chili Peppers\nIn late 1996, after more than five years of addiction to heroin Frusciante went cold turkey. However months later he was unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by his longtime friend Bob Forrest Frusciante checked into Las Encinas a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena. He was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection which could only be alleviated by removing his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later Frusciante checked out of Las EncinasFrusciante began living a more spiritual ascetic lifestyle. He changed his diet becoming more healthconscious and began eating mostly unprocessed foods. Through regular practice of vipassana and yoga he discovered the effect that selfdiscipline has on the body. To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music Frusciante decided to abstain from sexual activity stating Im very well without it. His attitude toward drug use changed saying\nI dont need to take drugs. I feel so much more high all the time right now because of the type of momentum that a person can get going when you really dedicate yourself to something that you really love. I dont even consider doing them theyre completely silly. Between my dedication to trying to constantly be a better musician and eating my health foods and doing yoga I feel so much more high than I did for the last few years of doing drugs.\nAt this point Im the happiest person in the world. These things do not fuck with me at all and Im so proud of thatyou dont know how proud I am. Its such a beautiful thing to be able to face life to face yourself without hiding behind drugs without having to have anger towards people who love you. There are people who are scared of losing stuff but you dont lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself.\nDespite his experience with addiction Frusciante does not view his drug use as a dark period. He considers it a period of rebirth during which he found himself and cleared his mind. Frusciante has since stopped practicing yoga due to its effects on his back but he still tries to meditate dailyIn early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro and were on the verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis The only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John back in the band. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band Frusciante began sobbing and said nothing would make me happier in the world. The group began recording their seventh album Californication released in 1999. Frusciantes return restored a key component of the bands sound as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music which affected the bands recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favoriteDuring the Californication world tour Frusciante continued to compose new material much of which would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for Ten Days. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records less markedly streamofconsciousness or avantgarde. However the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Californication focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers a distinctive feature of the recordIn 2001, Frusciante began recording his fourth album with Red Hot Chili Peppers By the Way 2002) he considered the time to be among the happiest in his life. He relished the chance the album gave him to keep writing better songs. While working on By the Way he also composed most of what would become Shadows Collide with People as well as the songs created for the film The Brown Bunny. His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as Johnny Marr John McGeoch and Andy Partridge. He wanted to listen to these musicians who werent just about technique but more about textures or as he put it people who used good chords. The album marked Frusciantes shift to a more groupminded mentality within the Red Hot Chili Peppers viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities.\n\n2002\u20132007: The Mars Volta 2004 recordings and Stadium Arcadium\nFrusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the By the Way tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and future Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer called Ataxia. The group was together for about two weeks during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days in the recording studio they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in New York City and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding. Later that year five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack.\n\nFrusciante released his fourth fulllength solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances from some of his friends including Klinghoffer and bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, he announced that he would be releasing six records over six months The Will to Death Ataxias Automatic Writing DC EP Inside of Emptiness A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track The Past Recedes. He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape avoiding modern studio and computerassisted recording processes. Frusciante noted These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for oneandahalf years. I made a list of all the songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that I was writing some of my best songs so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life.\nIn early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth studio album with the Red Hot Chili Peppers Stadium Arcadium. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks. Although usually following a less is more style of guitar playing he began using a full twentyfour track mixer for maximum effect. In the arrangements he incorporates a wide array of sounds and playing styles similar to the funkinfluenced Blood Sugar Sex Magik or the more melodic By the Way. He also changed his approach to his playing opting to contribute solos and let songs form from jam sessions. In an interview from Guitar World Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album Stadium Arcadium completely differently from those for their previous albums. On Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound. For Stadium Arcadium almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot. Several reviews have stressed that the influence of Hendrix is evident in his solos on the album with Frusciante himself backing this up. He also expanded the use of guitar effects throughout the album and used various other instruments such as the synthesizer and mellotron. He worked continuously with Rubin overdubbing guitar progressions changing harmonies and using all his technical resourcesFrusciante began a series of collaborations with friend Omar Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez and his band the Mars Volta by contributing guitar and electronic instrumentation to song Cicatriz ESP off their album DeLoused in the Comatorium. He also contributed guitar solos on their 2005 album Frances the Mute. In 2006, he played guitar on seven of the eight tracks on The Mars Voltas Amputechture In return Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez has played on several of Frusciantes solo albums as well as making a guest appearance on Stadium Arcadium.\n\n2007\u20132009: Second departure from the Chili Peppers and The Empyrean\nAtaxia released its second and final studio album AW II in 2007. Following the Stadium Arcadium tour early May 2006 to late August 2007) the Red Hot Chili Peppers agreed to a hiatus of indefinite length. In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this citing exhaustion from constant work since Californication as the main reason. Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, two months after the band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitaristFrusciantes tenth solo album The Empyrean was released on January 20, 2009, through Record Collection. The recorda concept albumwas in production between December 2006 and March 2008. The Empyrean features an array of musicians including Frusciantes Chili Peppers bandmate Flea friends Josh Klinghoffer and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr as well as guest musicians including Sonus Quartet and New Dimension Singers. Frusciante stated Im really happy with the record and Ive listened to it a lot for the psychedelic experience it provides suggesting the album is to be played as loud as possible and is suited to dark living rooms late at night.\n\n2010\u20132019: Shift to electronic music\nAfter leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers Frusciante focused on making electronic music. He learned to program instruments associated with acid house and wrote on his blog My skills at making rock music were playing no part in it whatsoever. I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and I was excited about finding new methods for creating music. During this time Frusciante founded an electronic trio with Aaron Funk and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms. Their first EP was released in December 2010 on Planet Mu RecordsFrusciante released an EP LeturLefr on July 17, 2012. As with his previous solo releases it was released through Record Collection Music. It marked a departure from the guitardriven sound of Frusciantes previous albums with elements of abstract electronica pop and hip hop. On September 25, 2012, Frusciante released his ninth studio album PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone. Frusciante released an instrumental Wayne on April 7, 2013, through his website. It was written and dedicated to the memory of his late friend the Red Hot Chili Peppers tour chef Wayne FormanOutsides Frusciantes fifth EP was released in August 2013. That year he produced and featured on an album by the hip hop group Black Knights. Medieval Chamber released on January 14, 2014. Frusciante also became involved in Kimono Kult a project including his wife Nicole Turley Omar Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez Teri Gender Bender Le Butcherettes Bosnian Rainbows string musician Laena Geronimo Raw Geronimo and guitarist Dante White Dante Vs. Zombies Starlite Desperation. Their debut EP Hiding in the Light was produced by Turley and was released on her record label Neurotic Yell in March 2014. A track Todo Menos El Dolor was released on SoundCloud on January 16. Having released Scratch a single recorded during the PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone sessions Frusciante released his tenth studio album Enclosure on April 8, 2014. In April 2015, Frusciante released his first album under the alias of Trickfinger. The album of the same name is Frusciantes first experimenting with the acid house genre. He previously released an EP Sect In Sgt under this alias in 2012.\nAcid Test Records announced on February 15, 2016, that Frusciante would release an EP of electronic music on April 16, 2016, entitled Foregrow. The EP was released on the 2016 Record Store Day and comprised the title track recorded for RZAs film The Man with the Iron Fists and three instrumental tracks.\nOn November 24, 2015, Frusciante announced that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008 to 2013 on his official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciantes rarely updated website in an open letter titled Hello audience where Frusciante provides an indepth response to the website that according to him took his words out of context. He writes I also must clear something up. I normally dont read my press but I heard about this quote recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline in which I said I have no audience. This has been misinterpreted and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. ... Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them and they know who they are. He continues Reduced to a single sentence it would have been accurate to say that at this point I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music.On June 13, 2017, Frusciante under the alias of Trickfinger announced that he would be releasing his second studio album Trickfinger II on September 8, 2017, on the label Acid Test. The six songs which were never intended to be released were originally recorded in 2007.\n\n2019\u2013Present Third tenure with the Chili Peppers\nOn December 15, 2019, the Red Hot Chili Peppers announced that Frusciante had rejoined replacing Klinghoffer. They had been working a new album with Klinghoffer but had made little progress. Frusciante said Flea had put the idea of rejoining in my head and I was sitting there with the guitar thinking that I hadnt written any rock music in so long. Could I still do that? His approach towards the Red Hot Chili Peppers and how he perceived himself within it had also changed from his last tenure with the band If I just try to let them be themselves rather than making my own visions the center of everything. It felt like if somehow any of us died leaving it the way it was it would be terrible. In an interview Klinghoffer said there was no animosity around his exit Its absolutely Johns place to be in that band ... Im happy that hes back with them. Flea said that artistically in terms of being able to speak the same musical language it was easier working with John.On February 8, 2020, Frusciante performed with the Chili Peppers for the first time in 13 years at a memorial service held by the Tony Hawk Foundation for late film producer Andrew Burkle son of billionaire Ronald Burkle. Frusciante said he had found it exciting to play guitar again after having focused on electronic music in his solo work for several years. Unlimited Love the Red Hot Chili Peppers twelfth studio album and their first with Frusciante in sixteen years was released on April 1, 2022. On June 4, the Red Hot Chili Peppers began an international stadium tour. On October 14, 2022, the Chili Peppers released their thirteenth studio album Return of the Dream Canteen which was recorded during the same sessions as Unlimited Love.\n\nIn 2020, Frusciante released the EPs Look Down See Us and She Smiles Because She Presses the Button under his electronic alias Trickfinger  and the instrumental electronic album Maya under his real name. He said he had become less interested in singing and writing lyrics and that he enjoyed the back and forth with machines and the computer. Frusciante and Flea contributed a cover of Not Great Men to a 2021 tribute album to Gang of Four The Problem of Leisure A Celebration of Andy Gill and Gang of Four. Frusciante released two versionsone mastered for vinyl and the other for CD and other streaming servicesof an ambient solo record I and II on February 3, 2023, stating after a year and a half of writing and recording rock music I needed to clear my head.\n\nCollaborations with Omar Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez\nFrusciante played guitar on five Mars Volta studio albums as well as Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pezs solo albums Se Dice Bisonte No B\u00fafalo and Calibration Is Pushing Luck and Key Too Far. He also functioned as executive producer for Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pezs directorial film debut The Sentimental Engine Slayer. The film debuted at the Rotterdam Film Festival in February 2010. Along with work on the film Frusciante and Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez have released two collaborative records in May 2010. The first is the album Omar Rodriguez Lopez  John Frusciante an album with just the two of them the other a quartet record Sepulcros de Miel consisting of Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez Frusciante Juan Alderete and Marcel Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez.\nIn a 2012 interview with Blare Magazine when asked about possible future collaborations with Frusciante Omar Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez said Maybe in the future but Johns in a different place right now. Hes in a place where he couldnt care less about putting things out or about something being a product. Hes living by different standards right now with a different philosophy so he doesnt want to be a part of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product. A Mars Volta record definitely ends up being a product.\n\nMusical style\nFrusciantes musical style has evolved over his career. Although he received moderate recognition for his early guitar work it was not until later in his career that music critics and guitarists alike began to fully recognize it. Frusciante attributes this recognition to his shift in focus stating that he chose an approach based on rhythmic patterns inspired by the complexity of material Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen produced. On earlier records he was influenced by various underground punk and new wave musicians. Rolling Stone named him the 18thgreatest guitarist of all time in 2003, the 25thgreatest guitarist of all time in 2023.\nIn general his sound is also defined by an affinity for vintage guitars. All the guitars that he owns records and tours with were made before 1970. Frusciante uses the specific guitar that he finds appropriate for a certain song. All of the guitars he owned before quitting the band were destroyed when his house burned down in 1993. The first guitar he bought after rejoining the Chili Peppers was a 1962 red Fender Jaguar. His mostoften used guitar however is a 1962 Sunburst Fender Stratocaster that was given to him as a gift from Anthony Kiedis after Frusciante rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998. He has played this guitar on every album since rejoining the Chili Peppers and their ensuing tours. He also owns a 1955 Fender Stratocaster his only Strat with a maple fretboard. Frusciantes most highly appraised instrument is a 1955 Gretsch White Falcon which he used twice per show for the songs Californication and Otherside. In 2006 and 2007, he only used it for the latter song saying there was no room for it preferring multiple Stratocasters for the Stadium Arcadium tour. Virtually all of Frusciantes acoustic work is played with a 1950s Martin 0\u201315After leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers he switched to using a Yamaha SG as his primary guitar for his solo work. With the Yamaha SG I could play along with guitar players who were playing say Les Pauls and feel like the sound matched what I was hearing on the record. ... People like Robert Fripp Mick Ronson Tony Iommi and particularly John McGeoch from Siouxsie and the Banshees who played a Yamaha SG which is why I bought one in the first place. Frusciante has also noted his increased use of the Roland MC202 for his electronic music saying that he was at the point where I thought as much like a 202ist as I did a guitarist. The MC202 has been his primary melodic instrument in his electronic musicWith the Red Hot Chili Peppers Frusciante provided backing vocals in a falsetto tenor a style he started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. He thoroughly enjoyed his role in the Chili Peppers as backing vocalist and said that backing vocals are a real art form. Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers he felt that his work with the band should remain separate from his solo projects. When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record Living in Hell a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with his role in the band.\n\nTechnique\nFrusciantes guitar playing employs emphasis on appropriate melody tone and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career he has said that he often minimizes this. He feels that in general guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he believes that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this he considers himself a fan of techniquedriven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai but represses an urge to emulate their style People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward but then they realize that emotionally they dont progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s. Believing that focusing only on clean tones is negative Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a grimy sound. As a result he considers it beneficial to mistreat his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many stylistic boundaries as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from todays guitarists is unoriginal also that many of his contemporaries follow the rules with no riskFrusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques he has stated that he felt comfortable with how RB and hip hop music integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP LeturLefr. PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his nowdeleted blog post My Recent History he notes that aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago as potentials but which I had no idea how to execute.Frusciantes approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings he welcomed sonic imperfections noting that even on To Record Only Water for Ten Days there are offpitch vocals and outoftune guitars. However on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People he pursued the opposite I just wanted everything to be perfectI didnt want anything off pitch or off time or any unintentional this or that. Frusciante views songwriting as taking time and does not force it If a song wants to come to me Im always ready to receive it but I dont work at it. Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can speed up the recording process and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible because he thinks music comes alive when you are creating it fast He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music Frusciante describes working with the computer as an instrument finding the ability to merge old and new production techniques. In the past Frusciante would work on one song of an album at a time but he later felt much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main digital audio workstation along with some drum machines sequencers and other hardware along with his Doepfer Arp and other modular synthesizers.\n\nInfluences\nFrusciantes first major influence was Jimi Hendrix. He then saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers at that point The was part of their name in concert in 1985, after which their thenguitarist Hillel Slovak became his second major influence with Frusciante coming to idolize Slovak. Although Hendrix and Slovak were arguably Frusciantes most profound influences he was also inspired by glam rock artists David Bowie and T. Rex as well as avantgarde acts such as Syd Barrett Captain Beefheart the Residents the Velvet Underground Neu Frank Zappa and Kraftwerk. Frusciante seems to be much influenced by progressive rock acts like Genesis King Crimson and Yes mentioning them in multiple interviews. Frusciante wrote an essay for the Yes box set The Word Is Live released in 2005.\nHe credits his inspiration for learning guitar to Greg Ginn Pat Smear and Joe Strummer amongst others. As an adolescent he began by focusing upon Hendrix as well as bands like Public Image Ltd the Smiths and XTC. Frusciantes other major influence was John McGeoch of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees. McGeoch is such a guitarist I aspire to be. He has a new brilliant idea for each song. I usually play on the stuff he does on Magazines albums and Siouxsie  the Bansheess like Juju. He has also mentioned Steve Howe as his favorite guitarist in his early teens.\nFrusciante explains which guitarists interest him by saying I like all kinds of guitar players but its people like the ones I just mentioned Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division whose playing really amazes me and its because of their ideas its because of what they thought. Its because they approached the instrument differently than anybody else. Its people like Keith Levene from Public Image and Daniel Ash in Bauhaus who are exploring the possibilities of what you can do with the guitar whereas other people seem like theyre just exploring what you can physically do and that serves no interest to me anymore.\nDuring the recording of Blood Sugar Sex Magik Captain Beefheart and the acoustic oneman blues of Lead Belly and Robert Johnson were among the most noteworthy influences. Frusciante cites RB singer Brandy as a musical inspiration and admires her voice calling it multidimensional and inspiring. In describing her voice and signature sound he said You cant hear the elaborate harmonies with your conscious you have to hear her voice with your subconscious. He also mentioned that Brandy was the main inspiration behind the guitar work on Red Hot Chili Peppers 2006 album Stadium ArcadiumOn Californication and By the Way Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from postpunk guitarists Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column and John McGeoch and bands such as the Smiths Fugazi and the Cure. He originally intended By the Way to be made up of these punky rough songs drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as the Germs and The Damned. However this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin and he instead built upon Californications melodicallydriven style. During the recording of Stadium Arcadium he moved away from his new wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van HalenFrusciante cites electronic musicin which the guitar is often completely absentas an influence. He has used his guitar to emulate the synthesizer melodies of Depeche Mode the Human League and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark drawing inspiration from how those acts were playing in a very minimal way where every note means something new. Frusciantes other electronic influences include Peter Rehberg Christian Fennesz and Ekkehard Ehlers. His interests are constantly changing as he believes that without change he will no longer have any interest in playing Im always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records and I go into each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine.\n\nDiscography\nAs a solo artistNiandra LaDes and Usually Just a TShirt 1994)\nSmile from the Streets You Hold 1997)\nTo Record Only Water for Ten Days 2001)\nFrom The Sounds Inside 2001)\nShadows Collide with People 2004)\nThe Will to Death 2004)\nInside of Emptiness 2004)\nCurtains 2005)\nThe Empyrean 2009)\nPBX Funicular Intaglio Zone 2012)\nEnclosure 2014)\nMaya 2020)\nI and II 2023)as Trickfinger\n\nSect In Sgt 2012)\nTrickfinger 2015)\nTrickfinger II 2017)\nLook Down See Us 2020)\nShe Smiles Because She Presses the Button 2020)with Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nMothers Milk 1989)\nBlood Sugar Sex Magik 1991)\nCalifornication 1999)\nBy The Way 2002)\nGreatest Hits 2003)\nStadium Arcadium 2006)\nUnlimited Love 2022)\nReturn of the Dream Canteen 2022)with Ataxia \n\nAutomatic Writing 2004)\nAW II 2007)Collaborations\n\nA Sphere in the Heart of Silence 2004; with Josh Klinghoffer\nOmar Rodriguez Lopez  John Frusciante 2010; with Omar Rodr\u00edguezL\u00f3pez\nMahandini 2018; with Dewa Budjana featured on Crowded  Zone\nThe Problem of Leisure A Celebration of Andy Gill and Gang of Four 2021; with Flea on the track Not Great Men\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nJohn Frusciante at IMDb", "Rita Corinne Hosking is an American composer and musician based in Davis California.

His biggest hit was 1977's Cat Scratch Fever on which he sang the lead vocals. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he was part of the supergroup Damn Yankees. In 2023, he embarked a farewell tour known as the Adios Mofo Tour.\nSince the 2000s Nugent has drawn attention for his outspoken conservative political views and his vociferous advocacy of hunting and gun ownership rights. He is a board member of the National Rifle Association and a strong supporter of the Republican Party.

Nugent himself never served in the military although he came of age during the height of the Vietnam War. In two 1977 and 1990 interviews with High Times magazine and the Detroit Free Press Nugent claimed he deliberately failed his draft physical by eating nothing but junk food for days beforehand and defecating and urinating in his pantsNugent denied his defecation story in a 2018 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience he asserted that he invented the story for his and his bands amusement as he claimed news sources at the time often published inaccurate information on his band. He also claimed that he was in fact eligible for military service and passed a draft physical in 1969 while he was attending Oakland Community College. Nugent affirmed that his 4-F rating on Wikipedia was made up. On The Joe Rogan Experience Nugent further claimed that he told the excrement story to the High Times just to have fun with its dirtbag and hippie writers in 1977 because he was hardcore antidrug however in 1990 he again detailed his experiences living inside pants caked with his own excrement for one week to avoid the draft in an extensive 1990 interview with the Detroit Free Press after the formation of Damn Yankees. He further stated on The Joe Rogan Experience that in 1969 he passed his draft physical with flying colors.Nugents Selective Service classification record Selective Service No. 11-101-48-1792) shows he initially qualified for and took student deferments.

He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist Dave Murray who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed the band Urchin which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing Dennis Stratton. Following a shortlived solo project called ASAP he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and after a yearlong hiatus formed the band The Untouchables which later became Psycho Motel. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. Smith and Dickinson would both return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. During his second tenure with Iron Maiden Smith has also led the side projects Primal Rock Rebellion and SmithKotzen.\n\nBiography\nEarly years and Urchin 1957\u20131980\nBorn in Hackney Smith grew up in Clapton. He purchased his first record Deep Purples Machine Head at the age of 15. This led him to befriend Dave Murray with whom he formed a band called Stone Free which comprised Murray on guitar Smith on vocals and their friend Dave McCloughlin playing the bongosAfter seeing the attention Murray received from girls Smith took up the guitar starting with an old Spanish guitar once owned by his brother before purchasing an old guitar of Murrays for 5. His early influences included Johnny Winter and Pat Travers which he claims made him a melodic player rather than a speed merchant or a shredder as he was inspired by blues rock rather than metal.Leaving school after completing his Olevels Smith formed the band Evil Ways including Dave Murray on guitar which was later renamed Urchin. Smith began writing his own material including a song called Countdown which evolved into 22 Acacia Avenue later included on Iron Maidens The Number of the Beast 1982). For a period of 2 years Smith had a job as a Water Bailiff and Fisheries Officer at the Walthamstow Reservoirs.\nMurray left Urchin to join Iron Maiden. Urchin then signed with DJM Records and released a single Black Leather Fantasy in 1977. Shortly afterwards Murray rejoined Urchin on their next single Shes a Roller as he had been sacked from Iron Maiden after an argument with singer Dennis Wilcock although he would be reinstated six months later. Smith was also offered a place in Iron Maiden while they were in the process of signing with EMI in 1979, but turned them down to continue with his own band a decision he later regretted as Urchin split up in 1980.\n\nFirst tenure in Iron Maiden 1980\u20131990\nShortly after Urchin split Smith encountered Steve Harris and Dave Murray on a street in his neighborhood and the two asked him to reconsider joining Iron Maiden as the replacement for guitarist Dennis Stratton. This time Smith accepted the offer and debuted with the band on a West German TV show Rockpop in Concert in Munich on 8 November 1980, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the Killers album released in 1981. Smiths first songwriting contributions appeared on The Number of the Beast copenning Gangland and The Prisoner as well as the previously mentioned 22 Acacia Avenue after which he began cowriting many songs with singer Bruce Dickinson on the following Piece of Mind albumSmith and Dave Murray combined playing dual lead guitars creating what AllMusic calls the most formidable twinguitar attack in heavy metal outside of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing. Smith along with Steve Harris also provides the bands backing vocals and sang lead on Reach Out the Bside to the Wasted Years single featuring Bruce Dickinson on backing vocals. Originally written by guitarist Dave Bucket Colwell with whom he had worked on The Entire Population of Hackney project Smith would later sing Reach Out again for Colwells solo album Guitars Beers  Tears released in 2010.\n\nDeparture from Iron Maiden and other projects 1989\u20131999\nWhile Iron Maiden were taking some time off in 1989, Smith released a solo LP with the band ASAP Adrian Smith And Project entitled Silver and Gold which was a commercial failure in spite of a promotional club tour. Unhappy with the direction the band were taking for their next release No Prayer for the Dying and feeling that he could not help enough in the creative work Smith left Iron Maiden in 1990 during the albums preproduction stages and was replaced by Janick Gers. After releasing the more progressive Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums in 1986 and 1988 respectively Steve Harris had decided that the band should go for a strippeddown and street level approach which Smith thought was a step backward. No Prayer for the Dying contained one last Smith song copenned with Bruce Dickinson entitled Hooks in You.After leaving Maiden Smith started a family with his Canadian wife Nathalie and also auditioned to replace the late Steve Clark in Def Leppard a position which ultimately went to former Dio guitarist Vivian Campbell. Smith joined Iron Maiden onstage at Donington Park in 1992 to Running Free. That performance appeared on the live album Live at Donington. In the same year after hearing Kings X for the first time he decided that he would love to play in a band like that and formed The Untouchables which later became Psycho Motel. The band recorded two albums State of Mind in 1995 and Welcome to the World in 1997, during which they supported Iron Maiden on the British leg of The X Factour. The project was put on hold however when Smith joined Bruce Dickinson for his 1997 album Accident of Birth after which he became a fulltime member of Dickinsons solo outfit embarking on two world tours and contributing to one further studio release 1998's The Chemical Wedding.\n\nReturn to Iron Maiden 1999\u2013present\nIn 1999, Smith rejoined Iron Maiden along with vocalist Bruce Dickinson who commented When he Smith left the band in 1990, I think everybody was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and certainly I dont think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him  big time. I wouldnt have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasnt in the band. I just dont think it would have been complete without Adrian and now its great having three guitarists. The band embarked on a short tour after which the new lineups first album Brave New World was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000He remains in Iron Maiden with whom he has released five further studio albums 2003's Dance of Death 2006's A Matter of Life and Death 2010's The Final Frontier 2015's The Book of Souls and 2021's Senjutsu. Smith claims that his guitar playing improved after leaving the band in 1990, in particular while working with Roy Z from whom he learned a lot about picking and became more disciplined. Since returning to Iron Maiden he has also continued experimenting with tuning which he began doing in Psycho Motel stating that he has used drop D tuning in live renditions of Run to the Hills Wrathchild The Trooper and Hallowed Be Thy Name. Although Smith had previously been known to contribute shorter more commercial tracks since his return to the band he has penned many longer songs beginning with Paschendale from Dance of Death.\n\nSide projects\nIn 2011, Smith formed the side project Primal Rock Rebellion with Mikee Goodman. They released the album Awoken Broken in February 2012. In 2020, Smith collaborated with Richie Kotzen under the name SmithKotzen.

He is best known for being the lead guitarist and cofounder of Los Angelesbased punk band The Germs and for being a rhythm guitarist for grunge band Nirvana which he joined as a touring guitarist in 1993) and Foo Fighters with whom he has recorded six studio albums. After Nirvana disbanded following the suicide of its frontman Kurt Cobain drummer Dave Grohl went on to become the frontman of Foo Fighters with Smear joining on guitar. Smear left Foo Fighters in 1997 before rejoining as a touring guitarist in 2005 and being promoted back to a fulltime member in 2010.\n\nEarly life\nSmear was born and raised in West Los Angeles California to a mother of AfricanAmerican and Native American descent and a German Jewish immigrant father. His parents enrolled him in piano lessons at a young age and a few years later he began teaching himself to play the guitar. Before becoming a musician he was a very religious child.\nAt age 13, he left home to join a commune. Later he attended Innovative Program School IPS an alternative school within University High School in Los Angeles. It was there he met vocalist Darby Crash alongside whom he would play in the Germs in the late 1970s. Smear and Crash were both expelled from IPS due to concerns they were inciting unruly behavior among the students.\n\nCareer\nThe Germs 1976\u20131980)\nSmear lists his influences as Joan Jett Brian James Brian May and Steve Jones. He also stated that all the guitar playing of John McKay on Siouxsie and the Bansheess first album really inspired me and that Yes guitarist Steve Howe is the best guitarist ever. As a teenager in 1976, Smear and Darby Crash formed the Germs with bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Dottie Danger the pseudonym of Belinda Carlisle who would go on to front The GoGos. Smear was the only band member who had any musical knowledge or proficiency at the time. For most of his time in the Germs Smear reported that he didnt own a guitar but rather just borrowed from whoever we were playing with.Carlisle was soon replaced by Don Bolles and in 1979, the band released their first album GI produced by Joan Jett. The record is now regarded as a milestone in the history of punk rock with Smear earning praise for his guitar work Smear has an equal claim to being the albums star alongside Darby though and for good reason  not only did he cowrite everything his clipped catchy monster riffing was as pure punk in the late70s sense as anything wasting no time on anything extraneous.The Germs along with Smear appeared in the punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization 1981) directed by Penelope Spheeris.  Darby Crash died before the film was released leading to the band breaking up.\n\nTwisted Roots  The Adolescents  45 Grave 1981)\nFollowing the demise of the Germs Smear played in 1981 with the exScreamers keyboardist Paul Roessler and his sister Kira Roessler in Twisted Roots. Although shortlived the band was the toast of the Hollywood punk scene. He also had a brief stint as a member of punk band the Adolescents in 1981.\nSmear was briefly in deathrock band 45 Grave with Don Bolles the former drummer for the Germs. During this stint they recorded a 7\" titled Black Cross and other tracks that would later appear on 45 Graves 1987 compilation album Autopsy.\n\nFilm career 1981-1986)\nDuring this time he also worked as an actor in bit parts appearing in the television shows Quincy ME. and CHiPs and in the films Blade Runner Breakin and Howard the Duck.  While working on Breakin Smear became friends with Courtney Love. He also appeared as an extra in the music video for Prince and the Revolutions single Raspberry Beret sitting in front of Lisa Colemans piano\n\nSolo career 1987-1992)\nSmear would go on to make two solo albums of his own Ruthensmear released in 1987 and recorded with Paul Roessler and So You Fell in Love with a Musician.. released in 1992.\n\nHole 1992)\nSmear recorded and mixed a cover of Circle One in December 1992 with Courtney Love on vocals and bass Smear and Eric Erlandson on guitar and Patty Schemel on drums. A 7-inch vinyl was released under the name The Holez in 1993. The cover later appeared on the compilation album A Small Circle of Friends in 1996.\n\nNirvana 1993\u20131994)\nIn 1993, he received a call from Nirvanas frontman Kurt Cobain asking him to join the band as a second guitarist for an upcoming tour. At first Smear thought his friend Carlos Cake Nunez was pranking him however Courtney Love had told Smear a few days prior that Cobain was going to call him. Smear accepted immediately and played his first show with Nirvana on Saturday Night Live on September 25, 1993. He toured with Nirvana for about six months. Smear appeared on their live albums MTV Unplugged in New York From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah as well as on material for the compilations Nirvana and With the Lights Out and the concert DVD Live and Loud.\n\nFoo Fighters 1994\u20131997)\nFollowing Cobains death Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl formed a band to support his selftitled album which would ultimately become known as Foo Fighters. Smear joined the group from its inception in late October 1994, but because their first album was a collection of demos recorded solely by Grohl Smear did not appear on a Foo Fighters album until The Colour and the Shape 1997).\nShortly after the release of The Colour and the Shape Smear quit the band. As Smear later explained he quit mainly due to exhaustion from the bands relentless touring schedule. Smears departure was also related to innerband tensions that sprung up around Grohls divorce from his first wife Jennifer Youngblood who was a close friend of Smear. Grohl explained that he begged Smear to stay and Smear agreed to remain in Foo Fighters temporarily due to scheduled touring obligations but only until a replacement guitarist could be recruited. Grohl eventually invited Franz Stahl his former bandmate from Scream to fill the lead guitarist slotSmear announced his departure from Foo Fighters during a live performance at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards he played partway through the set then introduced Stahl who completed the gig.\n\nHiatus from Foo Fighters and Germs Reunion 1997\u20132008)\nSmear kept a fairly low profile during his absence from Foo Fighters. He produced the debut album for the band Harlow and made scattered television appearances. He was employed as a creative consultant in a motion picture about the Germs and Darby Crash entitled What We Do Is Secret named after one of the bands bestknown songs. The film was released at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 23, 2007, and had a limited theatrical release in 2008 and now available on DVD. In the film Smear is depicted by actor Rick Gonzalez. In 2005, he began performing reunion shows with the Germs including actor Shane West who portrays Darby Crash in the film filling in as lead vocalist.\n\nRejoining Foo Fighters 2005\u2013present\nIn late 2005, Smear began performing select shows with Foo Fighters again. He continued to play intermittently with the group often not for the entirety of a concert as a touring musician for the next five years. Smear appeared with the Foo Fighters as an additional musician on their live acoustic album Skin and Bones 2006) contributing acoustic and electric guitar. He was also featured as a guest musician on the groups sixth studio album Echoes Silence Patience  Grace 2007) playing rhythm guitar on the track Let It Die. Smear described his participation as the oddest recording experience I had with Foo Fighters given he had no input in composition and was going in and playing on a song that was already written.In August 2010, Foo Fighters began recording their seventh studio album Wasting Light with producer Butch Vig. The recording sessions were documented on the bands website and Twitter with Smear being present in many of the photos that were posted. A December press release confirmed that Smear was part of the project and was considered a core member of the band once again becoming the bands third guitarist alongside Grohl and Chris Shiflett. The album was released on April 12, 2011, marking the groups first studio release with Smear as an official member since The Colour and the Shape in 1997.

Every song on the album was written and recorded in a different city across the United States and features guest musicians with ties to that citys musical history. The process was filmed for a companion television series Foo Fighters Sonic Highways which was broadcast on HBO in the months surrounding the albums release. Sonic Highways was released on November 10, 2014 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.\nIn 2017, the Foo Fighters released their ninth studio album Concrete and Gold. Smear once again performed guitar on all tracks as well as contributed percussion on the songs Run and Happy Ever After Zero Hour. The groups tenth studio album Medicine at Midnight was released on February 5, 2021 and went on to win three Grammy Awards including Best Rock Album.

They were officially selected as part of the 2021 induction class on May 12, 2021.\nOn October 30, 2021, Smear was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Foo Fighters. His former bandmate from The Germs Belinda Carlisle was inducted the same year as a member of The GoGos.\nSmear appeared alongside his bandmates in the comedy horror film Studio 666, directed by BJ McDonnell. The film was released on February 25, 2022 and received mixed reviews.\n\nNirvana reunions\nDuring the Foo Fighters Friday night performance at Bumbershoot Festival on August 29, 1997, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic joined his former bandmates Dave Grohl and Pat Smear on stage for the Foos encore to salute the late Kurt Cobain. Grohl took his position on drums Novoselic played bass and Smear accompanied on guitar. A spotlight encompassed the microphone stand to honor Cobain who died by suicide on April 5, 1994. They performed a cover of Princes Purple Rain after which a roadie for the Foo Fighters joined them on stage and sang a version of Led Zeppelins Communication Breakdown.\nOn December 22, 2010, the remaining members of Nirvana played together during a Foo Fighters show at Paladinos in Tarzana California which was recorded for a documentary.\nOn December 12, 2012, Smear Novoselic and Grohl reunited again for a televised Live Aid Hurricane Sandy benefit.

Smear now primarily uses Gibson guitars. He can be seen with classic models such as a White SG Custom or a Les Paul but mostly custom shop variations on the rare Johnny A model. Smear also uses a Gibson Barney Kessel model guitar while playing with the Foo FightersFor the MTV Unplugged in New York performance Smear used a Buck Owens American acoustic guitar which belonged to Krist Novoselic.\n\nPersonal life\nAccording to the 2011 documentary Foo Fighters Back and Forth Smear was married at the time and has at least one child.\n\nDiscography\nWith the Germs\n\nFormingSexboy 1977)\nLexicon Devil 1978)\nGI 1979)\nThe Decline of Western Civilization Soundtrack 1980)\nWhat We Do Is Secret 1981)\nLive at the Whisky First Show Ever 1981)\nGermicide 1985)\nMIA The Complete Anthology 1993)With The Martyrs\n\nPig Pen Victim  Social Sacrifice 7\" 1979)With 45 Grave\n\nBlack CrossWax 1981)With Twisted Roots\n\nPretentiawhat 1981)\nTwisted Roots Comp 2004)With Vagina Dentata\n\nWork Till Your Dead  Flipside Video Fanzine Number Five Comp VHS 1984)\nGolden Boys   Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Vol. 2 Comp 1985)\nCreep Street  Chaotic Reasoning Vol. 2 Comp 2012)With Tater Totz\n\nAlien Sleestacks From Brazil Unfinished Music Volume 3) 1988)\nMono!

Pat Smear Biography. AllMusic. Rovi Corporation. Retrieved July 20, 2013.\nPat Smear discography at Discogs \nPat Smear at IMDb", "Devin Garrett Townsend born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian singer songwriter musician and record producer. He founded extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad and was its primary songwriter vocalist and guitarist from 1994 to 2007. He has also had an extensive solo career and has released a total of 28 albums across all of his projects as of 2022.\nAfter performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school Townsend was discovered in 1993 by a record label who asked him to perform lead vocals on Steve Vais album Sex  Religion. After recording and touring with Vai he was discouraged by what he found in the music industry and vented his anger on his 1995 solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing which he released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band of the same name with whom he released the critically acclaimed album City in 1997. Since then he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad along with solo material released under his own independent HevyDevy Records label.\nTownsends solo albums have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians and are a mix of hard rock progressive metal ambient and newage. In 2002, he formed the Devin Townsend Band which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a twoyear hiatus he began recording again and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. This band began with a series of four albums released from 2009 to 2011 and each written in a different genre. Townsend continued to record and tour under the new moniker until January 2018.\nAcross all his bands and solo projects Townsend has released 23 studio albums and four live albums. His trademark production style featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound has been compared to the styles of Robert Fripp and Frank Zappa. His vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an operaesque singing while his musical style is rooted in metal and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality.\n\nBiography\nEarly musical career 1972\u20131994)\nDevin Garrett Townsend was born in New Westminster on May 5, 1972. His parents are of Irish and British descent with his father working in the restaurant industry. He picked up the banjo when he was five and began playing guitar when he was 12. As a young teenager he befriended Brian Beav Waddell who would later play guitars as part of the Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project. He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19. Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud both of whom would later become members of Townsends flagship band Strapping Young Lad. In 1993, Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes a project he later described as just as violent as Strapping Young Lad.Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels. Relativity Records responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album Promise. Shortly afterward the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai. Impressed with Townsends vocal work Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album Sex  Religion. After recording Sex  Religion Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album. Townsend soon landed a second tour this time with the opening band of Vais tour the Wildhearts. He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge. Ginger the bands frontman remained close friends with Townsend later cowriting several songs on Infinity and the Christeen  4 Demos EP.\nWhile on tour with the Wildhearts Townsend formed a shortlived thrash metal project with Metallicas thenbassist Jason Newsted. The band known as IR8, featured Newsted on vocals and bass Townsend on guitar and Tom Hunting of Exodus on drums. The group recorded a few songs together although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that. People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD which is absolutely not true he explains. People took this project way too seriously. A demo tape was put together but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation.\nThough Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. I was becoming a product of somebody elses imagination and it was mixing with my own personality he later reflected. This combination was appalling. He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite touring with other musicians however Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vais offer seeing no commercial appeal in Townsends music. I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts Townsend received a phone call from Monte Conner thenAR representative for Roadrunner Records expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. After being briefly signed by the label the offer was ultimately rescinded by Cees Wessels the owner of Roadrunner who regarded Townsends recordings as just noise.\n\nHeavy as a Really Heavy Thing through Infinity 1994\u20131998)\nIn 1994, Century Media Records offered Townsend a contract to make some extreme albums. He agreed to a fivealbum deal with the record label and also provided much of the guitar work on the 1994 album Millennium and the 1995 album Hard Wired by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly. Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He avoided using his real name at this point in career looking for a fresh start after his highprofile Vai gig. At the beginning I wanted to avoid at all cost to use my name because I was known as the singer for Steve Vai and it wasnt the best publicity to have he later explained. I was playing somebody elses music and I was judged in respect to that music. Townsend produced and performed nearly all the instruments on the debut studio album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing which was released in April 1995.\nFollowing the release of the record Townsend and several other musician friends he knew in Vancouver recorded a rock opera in 1996 entitled Punky Br\u00fcster  Cooked on Phonics. Written and recorded in under a month the album tells the fictional story of a death metal band from Poland that sells out becoming a punk rock band to achieve mainstream success. Townsend founded his own independent record label HevyDevy Records to release the album.\nTownsend assembled a permanent lineup of Strapping Young Lad to record City including prolific metal drummer Gene Hoglan Dark Angel Death Testament along with Townsends former bandmates Jed Simon on guitar and Byron Stroud on bass. The industrialinfluenced album was released in 1997. To this day the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lads best work with Metal Maniacs calling it groundbreaking and Revolver naming it one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Townsend himself considers it the bands ultimate album. Later that year Townsend released his second solo album Ocean Machine Biomech. The album featured a mix of hard rock ambient and progressive rock.\nDating back to the Sex and Religion tour Townsend had been writing solo material for a project called Ocean Machine. The album initially entitled Biomech was recorded in 1995 and originally queued for release later that year in December on HevyDevy Records a label created by Townsend solely for material he releases on his own. Due to unknown reasons Ocean Machine Biomech was put off for release until late 1996, but when the time came to finally release it Townsend had become unsatisfied with the recordings rerecorded the entire album and finally released in Japan on July 21, 1997.\nDuring this period Townsend was also asked to audition for the lead vocalist spot in Judas Priest after Rob Halfords departure. Though a fan of the band he turned down the offer explaining that No one would want to see Devin Townsend singing for Judas Priest. I mean its ridiculous.After the completion of City and Ocean Machine Biomech Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. He explained I started to see human beings as little lonesome water based pink meat life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other little pieces of meat seemed to understand. In December 1997, he checked himself into a mentalhealth hospital where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from he felt his disorder gave birth to the two extremes that are Strappings City record and Ocean Machine Biomech. After being discharged from the hospital Townsend found that everything just clicked and he was able to write his third solo album Infinity which he described as the parent project of City and Ocean Machine Biomech with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio accompanied by Hoglan to work on the album on which Townsend played most of the instruments. Infinity was released in October 1998. Later in his career Townsend has cited Infinity as his favorite solo recordWith Infinity Townsend began to label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad under his own name dropping the Ocean Machine moniker to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine Biomech under Townsends name to reflect the new arrangement. Townsends bandmates began to play two sets at their shows one as Strapping Young Lad and one as the Devin Townsend Band playing songs from Townsends solo albums.\n\nPhysicist and Terria 1999\u20132001)\nTownsends next project took several years to come to fruition. After the creation of the IR8 demo tape Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called Fizzicist which they described as heavier than Strapping Young Lad. When the IR8 tape was leaked Newsteds Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich learned of the project. Hetfield was fucking pissed that Newsted was playing outside the band and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects although Townsend would later downplay Metallicas role in Newsteds unavailability. With the project stalled Townsend instead wrote the album himself entitling it Physicist. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album. The thrashinfluenced Physicist was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsends career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed and Townsend considers it his worst album to dateFeeling he had ostracized a bunch of fans with Physicist Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record. Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band and looked to write an introspective album dedicated to his homeland. He produced and recorded Terria a highly illustrated streamofconsciousness album with Gene Hoglan on drums Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited Weens White Pepper as an inspiration for the album. Terria was released in November 2001.\n\nStrapping Young Lad through Synchestra 2002\u20132006)\nTownsends solo run lasted until 2002. After a fiveyear break from recording Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album Strapping Young Lad as an emotional response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States. If the worlds about to blow up said Townsend lets write the soundtrack for it. The albums lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the hostile lyrics of City. Musically Strapping Young Lad was less industrial than City and more reminiscent of death metal with a largerthanlife rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly Grotus and Samaels Passage as influences. The selftitled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews with critics finding it inferior to City but it was the bands first charting album entering at 97th place on Billboards Top Heatseekers chart.\nWhile Strapping Young Lad was being reunited Townsend formed a new permanent band on par with Strapping to record and tour for his solo releases. The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian Beav Waddell on guitar Mike Young on bass Ryan Van Poederooyen on drums and Dave Young on keyboards. Townsend performed guitar vocals and production as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend worked on the bands first album Accelerated Evolution at the same time he was working on Strapping Young Lad spending half the week on one and half on the other. Accelerated Evolution named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year was released a month after Strapping Young Lad. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called it the album of the year praising it for the hardtoaccomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible simultaneously heavy n rockin yet majestic and beautiful. Prior to the formation of the Devin Townsend Band Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of Accelerated Evolution Townsends two bands toured separately for their separate albumsStrapping Young Lad began working on their next album Alien in March 2004. Feeling that the bands previous album did not live up to expectations Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. During the process of writing and recording the new album Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder because he began expressing doubt about the initial diagnosis and decided to stop taking the medication but continued with his substance abuse and he eventually flipped out during the process and later called the resulting album toxic and psychologically very unhealthy. Although Townsend considered the album an impenetrable mass of technicality it was well received on its release selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game Fallout Brotherhood of SteelShortly thereafter Townsend began putting together the next Devin Townsend Band record with the working title Human. Townsend intended the album as the more pleasant counterpart to Alien. Its basically a record about coming back down to earth after being in space with Alien for a while. The album ended up being renamed Synchestra and was released in January 2006. Townsend showcased a wide variety of musical styles in Synchestra blending his trademark pop metal with influences from folk polka and Middle Eastern music.\nThe final Strapping Young Lad album The New Black was released later in 2006.\n\nZiltoid the Omniscient and hiatus 2006\u20132008)\nTownsend withdrew from touring to spend time with his family. From home Townsend completed his second solo ambient album The Hummer releasing it exclusively on his website in November 2006.\nIn May 2007, Townsend released Ziltoid the Omniscient a tongueincheek rock opera about the eponymous fictional alien. This was truly a solo album he programmed the drums using Drumkit from Hell a software drum machine that uses samples recorded by Tomas Haake of Meshuggah and played all other instruments himself. Shortly after the albums release Townsend announced that he no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or the Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was burnt out on travelling touring and self promotion and wished to do production work write albums and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touringIn 2008, Townsend lent his voice to characters in several episodes of the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse see Musician cameos in Metalocalypse for more. The original character design for Pickles the Drummer one of the series main characters bore a striking resemblance to Townsend. The series cocreator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity and altered the design before the series began. We made sure he didnt look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldnt look like that.\n\nCreation of the Devin Townsend Project 2008\u20132012)\nAfter removing himself from the music industry Townsend cut his trademark hair off and gave up drinking and smoking. Townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician. He spent a year producing albums in absence of writing but found it unrewarding and decided to pick up the guitar and just write. This began a period of self discovery where he learned how to create without drugs.Over two years Townsend wrote over 60 songs and found that they fit into four distinct styles. In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a fouralbum series called Devin Townsend Project with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being accountable for the persona he projects to the public. The projects concept includes a different theme and a different group of musicians on each albumKi the first album of the Devin Townsend Project tetralogy was written to set the stage for the subsequent albums. Townsend channelled his newfound control and sobriety into Ki a tense quiet album which contrasts with much of the music he had been known for. Additional female vocals were provided by Ch\u00e9 Aimee Dorval Casualties of Cool. Ki was released in May 2009.\nThe second entry a commercial yet heavy album called Addicted was released in November 2009 and features lead vocals from Townsend and Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen. Brian Beav Waddell was recruited from the Devin Townsend Band to play bassTownsend returned to the stage in January 2010, touring North America with headliner Between the Buried and Me as well as Cynic and Scale the Summit. This was followed by a headlining tour in Australia and a series of highprofile shows in Europe for example coheadlining the Brutal Assault festival in Czech Republic. He headlined a North American tour with UK label mates TesseracT supporting which began in October 2010, and toured in Europe with support from Aeon Zen and Anneke van GiersbergenThe third and fourth albums in the Devin Townsend Project series Deconstruction and Ghost were released simultaneously on June 21, 2011. In December 2011 all four Devin Townsend Project albums with additional material were released as the Contain Us box set. Townsend performed all four of Devin Townsend Project albums in London and recorded them for a DVD box set called By a Thread Live in London 2011 that was released on June 18, 2012. The first three shows were held at the University of London Union November 10\u201312, 2011. Ki Addicted and Deconstruction were each performed on one night respectively. The show for Ghost was held at the Union Chapel Islington on November 13, 2011. These four shows were each entitled An Evening with the Devin Townsend Project.Despite the Devin Townsend Project being originally a fouralbum series Townsend decided to continue working under the moniker and released the fifth album Epicloud on September 18, 2012. Again featuring Anneke van Giersbergen on vocals Epicloud appeared on several European charts peaking at number 8 in Finland. On October 27, 2012, Townsend performed a oneoff show covering his musical career called The Retinal Circus at Roundhouse in London. The 3-hour performance was recorded in high definition and released on DVD and Bluray on September 30, 2013. Also in 2012, Townsend played bass on the debut Bent Sea album Noistalgia. He also produced the recordAnother project Townsend has mentioned several times between 2009 and 2012 is Obviouser an album featuring creepy bass driven apocalyptic music created with an Ampeg rig and an Icelandic choir. Working with many projects simultaneously at that time Townsend stated in 2012 the Obviouser project is vying for pole position until he wakes up and says he wants to do it.\n\nCasualties of Cool and Z2 2012\u20132014)\nAfter Deconstruction and Ghost Townsend announced a new album Casualties of Cool with which he started to work after the release of Epicloud. The album features Ch\u00e9 Aimee Dorval from Ki on vocals and Morgan \u00c5gren on drums. Townsend described the album sounds like haunted Johnny Cash songs and late night music highlighting it will be different than anything he has done before. Townsend referred the music of the album to be closest to his heart at this point of his life and that it is an important and satisfying project he does not want to rush.\nThe album was completed in November 2013, and a bonus disc was also made for the album containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from Ghost 2, the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from Ghost. Originally in 2012, Townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the Devin Townsend Project series but he ultimately confirmed that Casualties of Cool is its own project. Townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through PledgeMusic to support the release of the album. The funding quickly reached its goal and all additional funds were put directly to Townsends upcoming projects. Casualties of Cool was released on May 14, 2014. The album was reissued worldwide on January 15, 2016, containing an additional DVD with live footage from the 2014 concert at the Union Chapel in LondonFrom 2009, Townsend worked on a longrunning album project called Z2, a sequel to the album Ziltoid the Omniscient 2007). Originally in 2012, he teased he may have just written the heaviest thing hes ever done for the album and stated there might a surprising lack of Ziltoid himself appearing on the album. However in August 2013, a Londonbased radio station TeamRock Radio aired the first episode of Ziltoid Radio a satirical radio show hosted solely by Ziltoid this being one element of the Z2 project. Townsend also discussed a ZTV or Ziltoid TV to precede the album. Townsend later stated he found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing stating it takes a lot of effort to keep the content and its tongueincheek humour entertaining.\nAfter writing ideas for over 70 songs Townsend stated he would finally finish the whole project followed by the announcement the album would be released on October 27, 2014. The recording process started in May 2014, and the final project includes the album a Ziltoid TV program and a live show with a big graphic novel comic and a documentary. The album itself is a double album with disc one featuring Devin Townsend Project material and disc two containing the main album. According to Townsend the albums theme is Ziltoid against the world. The Devin Townsend Project disc is called Sky Blue and the Ziltoid disc is called Dark MattersAfter finishing the album Townsend stated the project was punishing and an absolute nightmare to complete due to amount of material against tight schedules. He also described the hardship of the project by telling if he was ever going to start drinking again the last months would have been it but now hes starting to get excited again. Later after the chaos of finishing it had subsided Townsend stated he is really satisfied with the resultTownsend recently discussed at least a yearlong hiatus beginning after the Z2 show taking place at the Royal Albert Hall on April 13, 2015. During the indefinitely long break Townsend intends to recharge his batteries get some inspiration and experiences and to see what the next chapter holds for him.\n\nTranscendence 2014\u20132017)\nIn 2014, Townsend recorded a poppysounding song in Los Angeles with producer Brian Howes but has decided against releasing. Townsend mentioned that he is against the project being contrived due to the current hard rock undertones in popular music. He described it as a lukewarm heavy metal Devin song. On December 11, 2015, Townsend announced via Twitter that he was recording vocals for a song by Steve VaiIn early 2016, Townsend completed the seventh DTP album entitled Transcendence at Armoury Studios in Vancouver. The album was released on September 9. On March 17, 2017, Devin Townsend Project played Ocean Machine live in its entirety at Hammersmith Apollo. On October 30, 2017, Devin announced that he was working on four new albums.\n\nBreak from Devin Townsend Project Empath 2018\u20132020)\nOn January 31, 2018, Townsend announced on his Facebook page that he was taking a break from the Devin Townsend Project and focusing on a number of other projects including the four new albums previously announcedOn January 15, 2019, Townsend announced his album Empath on which work had been completed and slated for release on March 29, 2019.

The podcast was to be published monthly via the same channel. Based on the first episode as well as Townsends Instagram the new series aim was as opposed to the original Devin Townsend Podcast series published on Townsends YouTube channel not to analyze his past records but rather to focus on a real time observation of the next ones.\n\nPersonal life\nTownsend is married to Tracy Turner whom he began dating when he was 19. She gave birth to their first son Reyner Liam Johnstan Townsend on October 4, 2006. Townsend and his family live in the Vancouver suburb of CoquitlamTownsend has been a vegetarian for ethical reasons since around the early 1990s but does not consider himself an activist. He has revealed in interviews that he suffers from depression. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around 1998, a condition that was unknowingly exacerbated by his alcohol and drug use at the time he has been sober and free of antipsychotic medication since 2007.\n\nMusical style\nProjects\nTownsend designed his two main projects the aggressive Strapping Young Lad and his more melodic solo material as counterparts. Strapping Young Lads music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres death metal thrash metal black metal and industrial metal. Townsends solo material blends many genres and influences with elements of atmospheric ambient music hard rock and prog rock along with glam metal and arena rock. He described it as a highly orchestrated type of expansive music based in hard rock and heavy metal. Dense and produced with a large amount of ambient elements. Despite Strapping Young Lads greater mainstream acceptance Townsend identifies more with his solo material and has never intended Strapping Young Lad to be the focus of his music.\n\nProduction style\nTownsend is synesthetic experiencing musical notes as colors and shapes. Partly due to this he simultaneously composes and mixes his music in what he describes as all autopilot practically without any deliberate application of music theory. As a selfproclaimed fan of multitracking Townsend has developed a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric layered wall of sound. Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions which are always marked by a sense of adventure intrigue chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics according to Mike G. of Metal Maniacs. Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase Ableton Live Logic Pro and Waves Audio plugins. Townsends musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself. He has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein August Burns Red and Misery Signals.\n\nPlaying style\nTownsend mainly uses Open C tuning for both six and seven string guitar. He now also uses Open B tuning and Open B flat tuning on his six string guitars. Townsends technique varies from fingerpicking power chords and polychords to sweeppicked arpeggios and tapping techniques. He is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects. He has expressed that he has no taste for shred guitar saying that Musically it doesnt do anything for me and that he only solos when he thinks that he can within the context of the song.\n\nVocals\nTownsend employs a variety of vocal techniques in his work including screaming growling or even falsetto. Daniel Lake of Decibel Magazine classifies Townsends voice as a semioperatic tenor.\n\nInfluences\nTownsend draws influence from a wide range of music genres most prominently heavy metal. Townsend has cited among others Judas Priest WASP Broadway musicals ABBA newage music Zoviet France Kings X Morbid Angel Barkmarket Grotus Janes Addiction Fear Factory and Godflesh as his influences and has also expressed his admiration for Meshuggah on several occasions calling them the best metal band on the planet. Townsend lists Paul Horn and Ravi Shankar as the two most important musicians in his life. The two songs that Townsend credits with changing the way he thought about music are The Burning Down by Kings X and Up the Beach by Janes Addiction. City was influenced by New York noise rock bands such as Foetus and Cop Shoot Cop and The New Blacks influences were Meshuggah and more traditional metal like Metallica. He is also influenced by orchestral and classical composers such as John Williams Trevor Jones and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nDiscography\nSteve Vai\nSex  Religion July 27, 1993)\n\nPunky Br\u00fcster\nCooked on Phonics March 19, 1996)\n\nStrapping Young Lad\nHeavy as a Really Heavy Thing April 4, 1995)\nCity February 11, 1997)\nStrapping Young Lad February 11, 2003)\nAlien March 22, 2005)\nThe New Black July 11, 2006)\n\nSolo albums\nOcean Machine Biomech July 21, 1997)\nInfinity June 17, 1998)\nPhysicist June 26, 2000)\nTerria November 6, 2001)\nDevlab December 4, 2004)\nThe Hummer November 15, 2006)\nZiltoid the Omniscient May 27, 2007)\nEmpath March 29, 2019)\nThe Puzzle December 3, 2021)\nSnuggles December 3, 2021)\nLightwork November 4, 2022)\n\nDevin Townsend Project\nKi May 22, 2009)\nAddicted November 17, 2009)\nDeconstruction June 20, 2011)\nGhost June 20, 2011)\nEpicloud September 18, 2012)\nZ2: Sky Blue October 27, 2014)\nZ2: Dark Matters October 27, 2014)\nTranscendence September 9, 2016)\n\nThe Devin Townsend Band\nAccelerated Evolution March 31, 2003)\nSynchestra January 31, 2006)\n\nCasualties of Cool\nCasualties of Cool May 14, 2014)\n\nEquipment\nTownsend played ESP six and sevenstring guitars from 1994 to 2009 during his endorsement with ESP. In the early days of Strapping Young Lad he was seen playing an ESP Flying Vstyle 6-string with a single EMG 81 pickup and a custom graphic designed by Townsend. This was the guitar that was used during the shows in support of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing and the shows in support of City. In addition to this guitar Townsend also utilized an ESP EXP Explorerstyle guitar with two EMG 81 pickups. During the late 1990s and the 2000s he was also seen with two ESP Telecaster models one white one black with EMG 81 pickups which were used for the majority of his sixstring material. Townsend also utilized two ESP Custom Shop Horizon 7-string guitars with a 27\" baritone scale and EMG 81-7 pickups which closely resembled ESPs Stephen Carpenter signature model. He has also been seen with the Stephen Carpenter SC607 and SC607B. He was also occasionally seen playing what is believed to be a Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster HSS during Accelerated Evolution and Synchestraera shows mainly for performing Deadhead. At the time this was the only guitar Devin Townsend was seen with that did not have EMG pickups but was modified with a Seymour Duncan STKS2n Hot Stack in the neck.\nAfter returning to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model essentially a Flying Vstyle 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup in the neck position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey one with a natural flametop finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit for Open C and Open B tuning respectively.\nIn 2012, Townsend announced that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semihollow body guitars. In regard to this Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavycom The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements and I cant say I really enjoyed it but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good.. I really like that V. However I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well a Sadowsky Tele set a Framus hollowbody group of guitars and the Vs. No one is entirely happy with that decision but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result.. The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play I really like regardless of brand.\nFor Strapping Young Lad and solo projects from 1996  2004, Townsend mainly used the Peavey 5150 head with Mesa Boogie and Marshall 4x12 cabinets for his main sounds. Around 2005, Townsend began to utilize MesaBoogie Dual Rectifier and Stiletto amp heads boosted with a Maxon OD808, running into MesaBoogie 2x12 cabinets and Marshall 4x12 cabinets. He would also run a 3rd signal into a 1990s Roland GP100, which would be amplified by a MesaBoogie tube power amp. He would still make use of the Peavey head for some solo recordings such as Synchestra. He switched to a Fractal Audio AxeFx system in 2010, replacing his entire MesaBoogie and Marshall rig. He has been through a number of outboard modules that were mainly used for echoreverb effects something that Townsend is known for as a part of his signature sound. One of his favorites is the Roland GP100, a unit that Townsend still uses along with his Fractal units. He also used a TC Electronic GForce in tandem with his MesaBoogie rig. Townsend also utilizes DAddario Strings .010-.052 and .010-.060) and Planet Waves Custom Series cables.\nAs of 2014, he reintroduced the Dual Rectifier into his rig using a wetdrywet setup with the Dual Rectifier being the center dry sound and the AxeFx being the stereo effected sounds using the model of the Dual Rectifier as a basis. In 2015, for live shows the Dual Rectifier was replaced with a Kemper Profiler Amplifier and the Roland GP100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal AxeFX.\nAt the 2016 NAMM Show Townsend introduced a signature set of Fishman pickups in the Fluence line and a signature Framus guitar that features an original body shapes the Fishman pickups and the Evertune Bridge.\nIn November 2017, Townsend posted to social media and forums that his equipment list had been reduced explaining how he had eliminated a number of pieces of equipment from his setup. He wrote I was working with many amp companies but I have made my choice and have settled on a single Axe Fx 2XL for my ENTIRE chain. I use Framus Guitars Fishman Pickups \nDAddario strings Fractal Axe Fx. One Rig to rule them all In 2018 Mooer released the Devin Townsend signature Ocean Machine pedal featuring twin delays reverb and looper with infinite feedback in a genuine collaboration which Townsend enthusiastically recommended. The relatively unusual pedal design was received well with 5 star reviewsIn 2023, Devin paired with guitar pick maker Acoustik Attak to release his signature Devin Townsend Earthtone pick.\n\nBand members\nMembers of recent touring band\nDevin Townsend  guitars lead vocals theremin\nMike Keneally  guitars keyboards backing vocals 2019\u20132020, 2023\u2013present\nJames Leach  bass 2021\u2013present\nDarby Todd  drums 2021\u2013present\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Media related to Devin Townsend at Wikimedia Commons\nHevyDevy Records\nDevin Townsend at AllMusic\nDevin Townsend at YouTube", "Peter Dennis Blandford Townshend  born 19 May 1945) is an English musician.

He and Roger Daltrey received The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016.\n\nEarly life and education\nTownshend was born in Chiswick West London at the Chiswick Hospital Netheravon Road in the UK. He came from a musical family his father Cliff Townshend was a professional alto saxophonist in the Royal Air Forces dance band the Squadronaires and his mother Betty n\u00e9e Dennis was a singer with the Sidney Torch and Les Douglass OrchestrasThe Townshends had a volatile marriage. Both drank heavily and had fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis whom Pete later described as clinically insane. The twoyear separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middleclass Acton and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents. His neighbourhood was onethird Polish and a devout Jewish family upstairs shared their housing with them and cooking with themmany of his fathers closest friends were JewishTownshend says he did not have many friends growing up so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like Gullivers Travels and Treasure Island. He enjoyed his familys frequent excursions to the seaside and the Isle of Man. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film Rock Around the Clock sparking his fascination with American rock and rollNot long thereafter he went to see Bill Haley perform in London Townshends first concert. At the time he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician instead he wanted to become a journalistUpon passing the elevenplus exam Townshend was enrolled at Acton County Grammar School. At Acton County he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose an experience that profoundly affected him. His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model. Though his father taught him a couple of chords Townshend was largely selftaught on the instrument and never learned to read music. Townshend and school friend John Entwistle formed a shortlived trad jazz group the Confederates featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns. The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church and covered Acker Bilk Kenny Ball and Lonnie Donegan. However both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock n roll with Townshend particularly admiring Cliff Richards debut single Move It. Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the groups drummer Chris Sherwin and purchased a reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar at his mothers antique shopTownshends brothers Paul and Simon were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively. Lacking the requisite grades to attend university Pete was faced with the decision of art school music school or getting a job. He ultimately chose to study graphic design at Ealing Art College enrolling in 1961. At Ealing Townshend studied alongside future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. Townshend dropped out in 1964 to focus on music fulltime.\n\nMusical career\n1961\u20131964: the Detours\nIn late 1961, Entwistle joined the Detours a skifflerock and roll band led by Roger Daltrey. The new bass player then suggested Townshend join as an additional guitarist. In the early days of the Detours the bands repertoire consisted of instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their lineup coalesced around Roger Daltrey on rhythm guitar Townshend on lead guitar Entwistle on bass Doug Sandom on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist. Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and according to Townshend ran things the way he wanted them.Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result Townshend with Entwistles encouragement became the sole guitarist. Through Townshends mother the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce who started booking the band as a support act for bands including Screaming Lord Sutch Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers Shane Fenton and the Fentones and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. In 1963, Townshends father arranged an amateur recording of It Was You the first song his son ever wrote. The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name. Townshends roommate Richard Barnes came up with The Who and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.\n\n1964\u20131982: The Who\nNot long after the name change drummer Doug Sandom was replaced by Keith Moon who had been drumming semiprofessionally with the Beachcombers for several years. The band was soon taken on by a mod publicist named Peter Meaden who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single Im the FaceZoot Suit they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them. The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best and dropped the High Numbers name reverting to the Who. In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument. The onstage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Whos live showsWith the assistance of Lambert the Who caught the ear of American record producer Shel Talmy who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song I Cant Explain as a deliberate soundalike of the Kinks another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, I Cant Explain was the Whos first hit reaching number eight on the British charts. A followup single Anyway Anyhow Anywhere credited to both Townshend and Daltrey also reached the top 10 in the UK. However it was the release of the Whos third single My Generation in November that according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson cemented their reputation as a hardnosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissedoff adolescents at the time. The Townshendpenned single reached number two on the UK charts becoming the Whos biggest hit. The song and its famous line I hope I die before I get old was very much about trying to find a place in society Townshend stated in an interview with David FrickeTo capitalise on their recent single success the Whos debut album My Generation The Who Sings My Generation in the US was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several James Brown covers that Daltrey favoured. Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band including Pictures of Lily Substitute Im a Boy and Happy Jack. Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album which became A Quick One While Hes Away. The album was subsequently titled A Quick One and reached No. 4 in the charts upon its release in December 1966. In their stage shows Townshend developed a guitar stunt in which he would swing his right arm against the guitar strings in a style reminiscent of the vanes of a windmill. He developed this style after watching Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards warm up before a show.\nThe Who commenced their first US tour on 22 March 1967. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites though not to the extent of his bandmate Moon. He also began experimenting with LSD though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the Monterey Pop Festival on 18 June. Released in December their next album was The Who Sell Out  a concept album based on pirate radio which had been instrumental in raising the Whos popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs and the Whos biggest US single I Can See for Miles. Despite the success of I Can See for Miles which reached No. 9 on the American charts Townshend was surprised it was not an even bigger hit as he considered it the best song he had written up to that pointBy 1968, Townshend became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. He began to develop a musical piece about a deaf dumb and blind boy who would experience sensations musically. The piece would explore the tenets of Babas philosophy. The result was the rock opera Tommy released on 23 May 1969 to critical and commercial success. In support of Tommy the Who launched a tour that included a memorable appearance at the Woodstock Festival on 17 August. While the Who were playing Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman jumped the stage to complain about the arrest of John Sinclair. Townshend promptly knocked him offstage with his guitar shouting Fuck off my fucking stage!In 1970, the Who released Live at Leeds which several music critics cite as the best live album of all time. Townshend began writing material for another rock opera. Dubbed Lifehouse it was designed to be a multimedia project that symbolised the relationship between a musician and his audience. The rest of the band were confused by its convoluted plot and simply wanted another album. Townshend began to feel alienated and the project was abandoned after he suffered a nervous breakdown. Much of the material intended for Lifehouse was released as a traditional studio album Whos Next. It became a commercial smash reaching number one in the UK and spawned two successful hit singles Baba ORiley and Wont Get Fooled Again that featured pioneering use of the synthesizer. Baba ORiley in particular was written as Townshends ode to his two heroes at the time Meher Baba and composer Terry Riley.\nTownshend began writing songs for another rock opera in 1973. He decided it would explore the mod subculture and its clashes with rockers in the early 1960s in the UK. Entitled Quadrophenia it was the only Who album written entirely by Townshend and he produced the album as well due to the souring of relations with Lambert. It was released in November and became their highest charting crossAtlantic success reaching No. 2 in the UK and US. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray called it prime cut Who and the most rewarding musical experience of the year. On tour the band played the album along to prerecorded backing tapes causing much friction. The tapes malfunctioned during a performance in Newcastle prompting Townshend to drag soundman Bob Pridden onstage scream at him and kick over all the amplifiers partially destroying the malfunctioning tapes. On 14 April 1974, Townshend played his first solo concert a benefit to raise funds for a London community centreA film version of Tommy was directed by Ken Russell and starred Roger Daltrey in the title role AnnMargret as his mother and Oliver Reed as his stepfather with cameos by Tina Turner Elton John Eric Clapton and other rock notables the film premiered on 18 March 1975. Townshend was nominated for an Academy Award for scoring and adapting the music in the film. The Who by Numbers came out in November of that year and peaked at No. 7 in the UK and 8 in the US. It featured introspective songs often with a negative slant. The album spawned one hit single Squeeze Box that was written after Townshend learned how to play the accordion. After a 1976 tour Townshend took a yearlong break from the band to focus on spending time with his familyThe Who continues despite the deaths of two of the original members Keith Moon in 1978 and John Entwistle in 2002). The band is regarded by many rock critics as one of the best live bands from the 1960s to the 2000s. The Who continues to perform critically acclaimed sets into the 21st century including highly regarded performances at The Concert for New York City in 2001, the 2004 Isle of Wight Festival Live 8 in 2005, and the 2007 Glastonbury FestivalTownshend remained the primary songwriter and leader of the group writing over 100 songs which appeared on the bands eleven studio albums. Among his creations is the rock opera Quadrophenia. Townshend revisited albumlength storytelling throughout his career and remains associated with the rock opera form. Many studio recordings also feature Townshend on piano or keyboards though keyboardheavy tracks increasingly featured guest artists in the studio such as Nicky Hopkins John Bundrick or Chris StaintonTownshend is one of the key figures in the development of feedback in rock guitar. When asked who first used feedback Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said\n\nPete Townshend was definitely the first. But not being that good a guitarist he used to just sort of crash chords and let the guitar feedback. He didnt get into twiddling with the dials on the amplifier until much later. Hes overrated in England but at the same time you find a lot of people like Jeff Beck and Hendrix getting credit for things he started. Townshend was the first to break his guitar and he was the first to do a lot of things. Hes very good at his chord scene too.\nSimilarly when Jimmy Page was asked about the development of guitar feedback he saidI dont know who really did feedback first it just sort of happened. I dont think anybody consciously nicked it from anybody else. It was just going on. But Pete Townshend obviously was the one through the music of his group who made the use of feedback more his style and so its related to him. Whereas the other players like Jeff Beck and myself were playing more single note things than chords.\nMany rock guitarists have cited Townshend as an influence among them Slash Alex Lifeson and Steve Jones.\n\n1972\u2013present solo career\nIn addition to his work with the Who Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend along with other devotees to Meher Baba recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings Happy Birthday I Am and With Love. In response to bootlegging of these he compiled his personal highlights and Evolution a collaboration with Ronnie Lane and released his first majorlabel solo title 1972's Who Came First. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs as well as a showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with the Faces bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album 1977's Rough Mix. In 1979 Townshend produced and performed guitar on the novelty single Peppermint Lump by Angie on Stiff Records featuring 11-yearold Angela Porter on lead vocalsTownshend made several solo appearances during the 1970s two of which were captured on record Eric Claptons Rainbow Concert in January 1973 which Townshend organized to revive Claptons career after the latters heroin addiction and the Paul McCartneysponsored Concerts for the People of Kampuchea in December 1979. The commercially available video of the Kampuchea concert shows the two rock icons duelling and clowning through Rockestra megaband versions of Lucille Let It Be and Rockestra Theme Townshend closes the proceedings with a characteristic splitlegged leapTownshends solo breakthrough following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon was the 1980 release Empty Glass which included the top10 single Let My Love Open the Door and lesser singles A Little Is Enough and Rough Boys. This release was followed in 1982 by All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes which included the popular radio track Slit Skirts. While not a huge commercial success noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as Townshends most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia. Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats releasing several storybased albums including White City A Novel 1985) The Iron Man A Musical 1989) and Psychoderelict 1993).\nTownshend also got the chance to play with his hero Hank Marvin for Paul McCartneys Rockestra sessions along with other rock musicians such as David Gilmour John Bonham and Ronnie Lane.\nTownshend recorded several concert albums including one featuring a supergroup he assembled called Deep End with David Gilmour on guitar who performed just three concerts and a television show session for The Tube to raise money for his DoubleO charity supporting drug addicts. In 1993, he and Des McAnuff wrote and directed the Broadway adaptation of the Who album Tommy as well as a less successful stage musical based on his solo album The Iron Man based upon the book by Ted Hughes. McAnuff and Townshend later coproduced the animated film The Iron Giant also based on the Hughes story.\nA production described as a Townshend rock opera and titled The Boy Who Heard Music debuted as part of Vassar Colleges Powerhouse Summer Theater program in July 2007On 2 September 2017 in Lenox Massachusetts Townshend embarked with fellow singer and musician Billy Idol tenor Alfie Boe and an orchestra on a short 5-date Classic Quadrophenia US tour which ended on 16 September 2017 in Los Angeles California.\n\n1996\u2013present latest Who work\nFrom the mid1990s through the present Townshend has participated in a series of tours with the surviving members of the Who including a 2002 tour that continued despite Entwistles deathIn February 2006, a major world tour by the Who was announced to promote their first new album since 1982. Townshend published a semiautobiographical story The Boy Who Heard Music as a serial on a blog beginning in September 2005. The blog closed in October 2006, as noted on Townshends website. It is now owned by a different user and does not relate to Townshends work in any way. On 25 February 2006, he announced the issue of a miniopera inspired by the novella for June 2006. In October 2006 the Who released their first album in 24 years Endless Wire.\nThe Who performed at the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show on 7 February 2010, playing a medley of songs that included Pinball Wizard Who Are You Baba ORiley See Me Feel Me and Wont Get Fooled Again. In 2012, the Who announced they would tour the rock opera Quadrophenia.\nThe Who were the final performers at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London performing a medley of Baba ORiley See Me Feel Me and My Generation.On 22 March 2018, Townshend stated that a new Who album should feature original songs by Roger Daltrey as well as him. That album simply titled Who was released on 6 December 2019. It was the bands second album as a duo and their first in thirteen years.\n\nUnfinished work\nThe Age of Anxiety formerly Floss the Musical is the name given to a workinprogress by Townshend. The musical has been a work in progress at least since 2009 with an original estimated release of 2011. On 24 January 2012 Townshend sold the rights to all of his back catalog and much of his future work including Floss The Musical if it is ever completed. He summarized the work in an interview with Sirius Satellite Radio published February 2010. In a 2015 interview Townshend stated that the work was intended to be an art installation. In March 2019 it was announced that a work entitled The Age of Anxiety would be published as a novel with an opera to follow.\n\nMusical influences\nTownshend was born ten days after Nazi Germany surrendered in the Second World War and grew up in the shadow of reconstruction in and around London. According to Townshend postwar trauma was the driving force behind the rock music revolution in the UK. Trauma is passed from generation to generation he said Ive unwittingly inherited what my father experienced. Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life. In his autobiography he wrote I wasnt trying to play beautiful music. I was confronting my audience with the awful visceral sound of what we all knew was the single absolute of our frail existenceone day an aeroplane would carry the bomb that would destroy us all in a flash. It could happen at any time.\nAlthough he grew up in a household with jazz musicians Townshend absorbed many of his ideas about performance and rock music themes during art school. Townshends roommate at Ealing Art College Tom Wright had a large record collection and Townshend listened to and became influenced by RB and rock  roll artists like Howlin Wolf John Lee Hooker Bo Diddley Booker T.  the MGs Little Walter and Chuck Berry. He was also strongly influenced by cellist Malcolm Cecil who often damaged his cello during performances along with Gustav Metzger pioneer of autodestructive art. In light of these influences guitar smashing became not just an expression of youthful angst but also a means of conveying ideas through musical performance. We advanced a new concept he writes. Destruction is art when set to music. Townshend also cited Robbie Basho as a significant influence saying Ive totally been influenced by him. You can hear it in my work.\n\nEquipment\nGuitars\nThroughout his solo career and his career with the Who Townshend has played a large variety of guitars  mostly various Fender Gibson and Rickenbacker models. He has also used Guild Takamine and Gibson J200 acoustic models with the J200 providing his signature recorded acoustic sound in such songs as Pinball Wizard.In the early days with the Who Townshend played an Emile Grimshaw SS De Luxe and 6-string and 12-string Rickenbacker semihollow electric guitars primarily particularly the RoseMorris UKimported models with special fholes. When the excited audience responded enthusiastically after he accidentally broke the head off his guitar on a low ceiling during a concert at the Railway Hotel pub in Wealdstone west London he incorporated the eventual smashing of his instrument into the bands performances. However as instrumentsmashing became increasingly integrated into the Whos concert sets he switched to more durable and resilient and importantly cheaper guitars for smashing such as the Fender Stratocaster Fender Telecaster and various Danelectro models. On the Whos The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour appearance in 1967, Townshend used a Vox Cheetah guitar which he only used for that performance the guitar was destroyed by Townshend and Moons drum explosion. In the late 1960s Townshend began playing Gibson SG Special models almost exclusively. He used this guitar at the Woodstock and Isle of Wight shows in 1969 and 1970, as well as the Live at Leeds performance in 1970.\nBy 1970 Gibson changed the design of the SG Special which Townshend had been using previously and he began using other guitars. For much of the 1970s he used a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe some with only two minihumbucker pickups and others modified with a third pickup in the middle position a DiMarzio Superdistortion  Dual Sound. He can be seen using several of these guitars in the documentary The Kids Are Alright although in the studio he often played a 59 Gretsch 6120 guitar given to him by Joe Walsh most notably on the albums Whos Next and QuadropheniaDuring the 1980s Townshend mainly used Fenders Rickenbackers and Telecasterstyle models built for him by Schecter and various other luthiers. Since the late1980s Townshend has used the Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster with Lace Sensor pickups both in the studio and on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pickup system to simulate acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra volume control behind the guitars bridge.\nDuring the Whos 1989 Tour Townshend played a Rickenbacker guitar that was ironically smashed accidentally when he tripped over it. Instead of throwing the smashed parts away Townshend reassembled the pieces as a sculpture. The sculpture was featured at the Rock Stars Cars And Guitars 2 exhibit during the summer of 2009 at The Henry Ford museum.\n\nThere are several Gibson Pete Townshend signature guitars such as the Pete Townshend SG the Pete Townshend J200, and three different Pete Townshend Les Paul Deluxes. The SG was clearly marked as a Pete Townshend limited edition model and came with a special case and certificate of authenticity signed by Townshend himself. There has also been a Pete Townshend signature Rickenbacker limited edition guitar of the model 1998, which was his main 6-string guitar in the Whos early days. The run featured 250 guitars which were made between July 1987  March 1988, and according to Rickenbacker CEO John Hall the entire run sold out before serious advertising could be done.\nHe also used the Gibson ES335, one of which he donated to the Hard Rock Cafe. Townshend also used a Gibson EDS1275 doubleneck very briefly circa late 1967, and both a Harmony Sovereign H1270 and a Fender Electric XII for the studio sessions for Tommy for the 12-string guitar parts. He also occasionally used Fender Jazzmasters on stage in 1967 and 1968 and in the studio for Tommy.\n\nAmps\nOver the years Townshend has used many types of amplifier including Vox Selmer Fender Marshall and Hiwatt sticking to using Hiwatt amps for most of four decades. Around the time of Whos Next he used a tweed Fender Bandmaster amp also given to him by Joe Walsh in 1970) which he also used for Quadrophenia and The Who by Numbers. While recording Face Dances and the collaborative album Rough Mix Townshend made use of a Peavey Vintage 4\u00d710 amplifier in the studio. Since 1989, his rig consisted of four Fender VibroKing stacks and a Hiwatt head driving two custom made 2\u00d712\" HiwattMesa Boogie speaker cabinets. However since 2006, he has only three VibroKing stacks one of which is a backup.\nTownshend figured prominently in the development of what is widely known in rock circles as the Marshall stack. He ordered several speaker cabinets that contained eight 12\" speakers in a housing standing nearly six feet in height with the top half of the cabinet slanted slightly upward. These were too heavy to move easily so Jim Marshall cut the massive speaker cabinet in half at the suggestion of Townshend with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.\nHe has always regarded his instruments as being merely tools of the trade and has in latter years kept his most prized instruments well away from the concert stage. These instruments include a few vintage and reissue Rickenbackers the Gretsch 6120, an original 1952 Fender Telecaster Gibson Custom Shops artist limited edition reissues of Townshends Les Paul DeLuxe models 1, 3 and 9 as well his signature SG Special reissue.\n\nKeyboards\nTownshend played keyboards on several Who songs. On Whos Next he began to work with analogue synthesizers using the ARP 2600 model that he first encountered at Cambridge University. He had this to say about the instrument I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that arent in my hands the sound of an orchestra French horns strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar youre stuck with as fast as you can play and I dont play fast I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth.The synths Townshend was referring to included the EMS VCS3 and ARP 2600, some of which modified a Lowrey TBO Berkshire organ. Current photos of his home studio also show an ARP 2500. Townshend was featured in ARP promotional materials in the early 1970sSince the late 1980s Townshend has predominantly used Synclavier Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition particularly solo albums and projects. He currently owns three systems one large Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio system originally installed in his riverside Oceanic Studio later transferred to a seagoing barge moored alongside the studio on the River Thames and currently based in his home studio. He also uses a special adapted smaller Synclavier 3200 system which can be transported enabling him to carry on working away from his main studio. This 3200 system was modified to be of similar specification to the 9600, including the addition internally of FM voices stereo Poly voices and with the large VPK keyboard. This is the only Synclavier 3200 system of this specification in existence customdesigned and built for Townshend by Steve Hills. The third system Townshend owns is one of the first Synclavier II systems ever built. The ORK original smaller keyboard of which is on display in his companys head office alongside a pink Vespa scooter.\n\nLiterary work\nAlthough known for his musical compositions and musicianship Townshend has been extensively involved in the literary world for more than three decades writing newspaper and magazine articles book reviews essays books and scripts.\nAn early example of Townshends writing came in August 1970 with the first of nine installments of The Pete Townshend Page a monthly column written by Townshend for the British music paper Melody Maker. The column provided Townshends perspective on an array of subjects such as the media and the state of US concert halls and public address systems as well as providing valuable insight into Townshends mindset during the evolution of his Lifehouse project.\nTownshend also wrote three sizeable essays for Rolling Stone magazine the first of which appeared in November 1970. In Love With Meher Baba described Townshends spiritual leanings. Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy a blowbyblow account of the Who compilation album of the same name followed in December 1971. The third article The Punk Meets the Godmother appeared in November 1977.\nAlso in 1977, Townshend founded Eel Pie Publishing which specialised in childrens titles music books and several Meher Babarelated publications. He also opened a bookstore named Magic Bus after the popular Who song in London. The Story of Tommy a book written by Townshend and his art school friend Richard Barnes now the Whos official biographer about the writing of Townshends 1969 rock opera and the making of the 1975 Ken Russelldirected film was published by Eel Pie the same year.\nIn July 1983, Townshend took a position as an acquisitions editor for London publisher Faber and Faber. Notable projects included editing Animals frontman Eric Burdons autobiography Charles Shaar Murrays awardwinning Crosstown Traffic Jimi Hendrix and PostWar Pop Brian Eno and Russell Millss More Dark Than Shark and working with Prince Charles on a volume of his collected speeches. Townshend commissioned Dave Rimmers Like Punk Never Happened and was commissioning editor for radical playwright Steven Berkoff.\nTwo years after joining Faber and Faber Townshend decided to publish a book of his own. Horses Neck issued in May 1985, was a collection of short stories hed written between 1979 and 1984, tackling subjects such as childhood stardom and spirituality. As a result of his position with Faber and Faber Townshend developed friendships with both Nobel prizewinning author of Lord of the Flies Sir William Golding and British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes. His friendship with Hughes led to Townshends musical interpretation of Hughess childrens story The Iron Man six years later as The Iron Man The Musical by Pete Townshend released in 1989.\nTownshend has written several scripts spanning the breadth of his career including numerous drafts of his elusive Lifehouse project the last of which cowritten with radio playwright Jeff Young was published in 1999. In 1978, Townshend wrote a script for Fish Shop a play commissioned but not completed by London Weekend Television and in mid1984 he wrote a script for White City A Novel which led to a short film.\nIn 1989 Townshend began work on a novel entitled Ray High  The Glass Household a draft of which was later submitted to his editor. While the original novel remains unpublished elements from this story were used in Townshends 1993 solo album Psychoderelict. In 1993, Townshend authored another book The Whos Tommy a chronicle of the development of the awardwinning Broadway version of his rock opera.\nThe opening of his personal website and his commerce site Eelpiecom both in 2000, gave Townshend another outlet for literary work. Eelpiecom was closed down in 2010 Several of Townshends essays have been posted online including Meher BabaThe Silent Master My Own Silence in 2001, and A Different Bomb an indictment of the child pornography industry the following year.\nIn September 2005, Townshend began posting a novella online entitled The Boy Who Heard Music as background for a musical of the same name. He posted a chapter each week until it was completed and novella was available to read at his website for several months. Like Psychoderelict it was yet another extrapolation of Lifehouse and Ray High  The Glass Household.\nIn 1997 Townshend signed a deal with Little Brown and Company publishing to write his autobiography reportedly titled Pete Townshend Who He? Townshends creative vagaries and conceptual machinations have been chronicled by Larry David Smith in his book The Minstrels Dilemma Praeger 1999). After a lengthy delay Townshends autobiography now titled Who I Am was released 8 October 2012. The book ranked in the top 5 of The New York Times best seller list in October 2012On 5 March 2019, Townshend announced that his debut novel titled The Age of Anxiety would be published on 5 November 2019 by Hodder  Stoughton imprint Coronet. Townshend called the work an extended meditation on manic genius and the dark art of creativity. The novel will be accompanied by an opera which is currently in development with an art installation to follow.\n\nSpirituality\nIn 1967 Townshend had begun to explore spirituality. Townshend swiftly absorbed all of Meher Babas writings that he could find by April 1968, he announced himself Babas disciple. At about this time Townshend who had been searching the past two years for a basis for a rock opera created a story inspired by the teachings of Baba and other writings and expressing the enlightenment he believed that he had received from them which ultimately became TommyIn interviews Townshend was more open about his beliefs penning an article on Baba for Rolling Stone magazine in 1970 and stating that following Babas teachings he was opposed to the use of all psychedelic drugs making him one of the first rock stars with counterculture credibility to turn against their use. This did not prevent him from later indulging in substance abuse. He wrote in Who I Am of becoming addicted to cocaine in 1980-1981, to the point of overdosing and needing resuscitation. He also wrote that by January 1982, I needed help to break my dependence on prescription drugs and heroin.\n\nPersonal life\nRelationships\nTownshend met Karen Astley daughter of film composer Edwin Astley while in art school. They married on 20 May 1968 and moved into a threebedroom townhouse in Twickenham in outer southwest London that overlooked the Thames. They have three children Emma born 1969) who is a gardening columnist Aminta born 1971) who works in film production and Joseph born 1989) who studied graphic design at Central St. MartinsTownshend and his wife separated in 1994. He has since been in a romantic relationship with arranger and musician Rachel Fuller whom he secretly married in 2016. Townshend lived at The Wick Richmond London England but sold the house in August 2021 for more than 15 million. He also owns a house in Churt Surrey and in 2010 purchased a lease of part of the National Trust property Ashdown House in Oxfordshire. According to The Sunday Times Rich List his assets were worth 40 million as of 2009.\n\nSexuality\nIn a 1989 interview with radio host Timothy White Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality referencing the song Rough Boys on his 1980 studio album Empty Glass. He called the song a coming out an acknowledgment of the fact that Id had a gay life and that I understood what gay sex was about. However in a 1994 interview for Playboy he said I did an interview about it saying that Rough Boys was about being gay and in the interview I also talked about my gay life whichI meantwas actually about the friends Ive had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the ts and crossed the is and assumed that this was a coming out which it wasnt at all. Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he is probably bisexual. Townshend also stated that he once felt sexually attracted to the Rolling Stones lead vocalist Mick Jagger.\n\nLegal issues\nTownshend accepted a caution from the Metropolitan Police the Met as part of Operation Ore a major investigation on child sexual abuse images conducted in 2002\u20132003. The Met stated that it was established that Mr Townshend was not in possession of any downloaded child abuse images. Townshend was on a sex offenders register for five years beginning in 2003, after admitting he had used his credit card to access a child sexual abuse images website. Townshend claimed he accessed the images as research in a campaign against child sexual abuse  specifically to prove that British banks were complicit in channelling the profits from paedophile rings. Authorities could not prove that the website accessed by Townshend involved children and no incriminating evidence was found on his personal computer.\n\nHearing loss\nTownshend suffers from partial deafness and tinnitus likely the result of noiseinduced hearing loss from his extensive exposure to loud music. The Who were renowned as a very loud band in their live performances some particular incidents include a Who concert at the Charlton Athletic Football Club London on 31 May 1976 that was listed as the Loudest Concert Ever by the Guinness Book of Records where the volume level was measured at 126 decibels 32 metres from the stage. Townshend has also attributed the start of his hearing loss to Keith Moons famous exploding drum set during the Whos 1967 appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy HourIn 1989, Townshend gave the initial funding to allow the formation of the nonprofit hearing advocacy group HEAR. Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers. After the Who performed at halftime at Super Bowl XLIV Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told Rolling Stone If my hearing is going to be a problem were not delaying shows. Were finished. I cant really see any way around the issue. Neil Young introduced him to an audiologist who suggested he use an inear monitor and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the WhoIn March 2011, Roger Daltrey said in an interview with the BBC that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but severe hearing loss and was now trying to save what remained of his hearing Petes having terrible trouble with his hearing. Hes got really really bad problems with it..not tinnitus its deterioration and hes seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing.\nReferring to that in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog My hearing is actually better than ever because after a feedback scare at the indigO2 in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies that are out of my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for TCT at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010. Im 66, I dont have perfect hearing and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus.\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1998, Townshend was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the UK Labour Party. He refused to let Michael Moore use Wont Get Fooled Again in Fahrenheit 9/11 2004) saying that he watched Bowling for Columbine 2002) and was not convinced. In 1961 while in art school Townshend joined the Young Communist League and was a prominent figure in their 1966 Trend recruitment campaign. In a 1974 Penthouse interview he stated that he recognised in practice he was a capitalist who was rewarded well for his work but that his ideals were communistIn a widely reported 2012 interview with ABC Townshend described himself jokingly as being a bit of a neocon stating that I like the idea of America as the worlds police force. Then we dont have to do it. You guys sort it out.In a 2019 interview with The Times Townshend revealed he was in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union stating Im a Remainer he Roger Daltrey is a Brexiteer. I believe in God he doesnt.\n\nCharity work\nTownshend has woven a long history of involvement with various charities and other philanthropic efforts throughout his career both as a solo artist and with the Who. His first solo concert for example was a 1974 benefit show which was organised to raise funds for the Camden Square Community Play Centre.\nThe earliest public example of Townshends involvement with charitable causes was in 1968, when Townshend donated the use of his former Wardour Street apartment to the Meher Baba Association. The following year the association was moved to another Townshendowned apartment the Eccleston Square former residence of his wife Karen. Townshend sat on a committee which oversaw the operation and finances of the centre. The committee sees to it that it is open a couple of days a week and keeps the bills paid and the library full he wrote in a 1970 Rolling Stone articleIn 1969 and 1972, Townshend produced two limitedrelease albums Happy Birthday and I Am for the Londonbased Baba association. This led to 1972's Who Came First a more widespread release 15 per cent of the revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release With Love was released in 1976. A limitededition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD Avatar was released in 2000, with all profits going to the Avatar Meher Baba Trust in India which provided funds to a dispensary school hospital and pilgrimage centre.\nIn July 1976, Townshend opened Meher Baba Oceanic a London activity centre for Baba followers which featured film dubbing and editing facilities a cinema and a recording studio. In addition the centre served as a regular meeting place for Baba followers. Townshend offered very economical reportedly 1 per night lodging for American followers who needed an overnight stay on their pilgrimages to India. Townshend wrote in a 1977 Rolling Stone article For a few years I had toyed with the idea of opening a London house dedicated to Meher Baba. In the eight years I had followed him I had donated only coppers to foundations set up around the world to carry out the Masters wishes and decided it was about time I put myself on the line. The Who had set up a strong charitable trust of its own which appeased to an extent the feeling I had that Meher Baba would rather have seen me give to the poor than to the establishment of yet another socalled spiritual center. Townshend also embarked on a project dedicated to the collection restoration and maintenance of Meher Babarelated films. The project was known as MEFA or Meher Baba European Film Archive.\n\nChildrens charities\nTownshend has been an active champion of childrens charities. The debut of Townshends stage version of Tommy took place at San Diegos La Jolla Playhouse in July 1992. The show was earmarked as a benefit for the Londonbased NordoffRobbins Music Therapy Foundation an organisation which helps children with autism and intellectual disabilityTownshend performed at a 1995 benefit organised by Paul Simon at Madison Square Gardens Paramount Theatre for the Childrens Health Fund. The following year Townshend performed at a benefit for the annual Bridge School Benefit a California facility for children with severe speech and physical impairments with concerts organised by Neil and Pegi Young. In 1997, Townshend established a relationship with Maryville Academy a Chicago area childrens charity. Between 1997 and 2002, Townshend played five benefit shows for Maryville Academy raising at least 1,600,000. His 1998 album A Benefit for Maryville Academy was made to support their activities and proceeds from the sales of his release were donated to themAs a member of the Who Townshend has also performed a series of concerts beginning in 2000 to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK which raised several million pounds. In 2005, Townshend performed at New Yorks Gotham Hall for Samsungs Four Seasons of Hope an annual childrens charity fundraiser. In the same year he donated a smashed guitar to the Pediatric Epilepsy ProjectOn 4 November 2011, Roger Daltrey and Townshend launched the DaltreyTownshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to be funded by the Whos charity Who Cares. The launch followed on 5 November by a fundraising event was also attended by Robert Plant and Dave GrohlIn 2024, Townshend contributed guitar to a rerelease of Mark Knopflers Going Home Theme of the Local Hero in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nDrug rehabilitation\nTownshend has also advocated for drug rehabilitation. In a 1985 radio interview he said\n\nWhat Im most active in doing is raising money to provide beds in clinics to help people that have become victims of drug abuse. In Britain the facilities are very very very lean indeed ... although we have a national health service a free medical system it does nothing particularly for class A drug addicts  cocaine abusers heroin abusers ... were making a lot of progress ... the British government embarked on an antiheroin campaign with advertising and I was coopted by them as a kind of figurehead and then the various other people coopted me into their own campaigns but my main work is raising money to try and open a large clinicThe large clinic Townshend was referring to was a drug treatment facility in London that he and drug rehabilitation experimenter Meg Patterson had devised but the plan failed to come to fruition. Two early 1979 concerts by the Who raised 20,000 for Pattersons Pharmakon Clinic in SussexFurther examples of Townshends drug rehabilitation activism took place in the form of a 1984 benefit concert incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band the Stone Roses an article he wrote a few days later for Britains Mail on Sunday urging better care for the nations growing number of drug addicts and the formation of a charitable organisation DoubleO Charities to raise funds for the causes hed recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fundraising antiheroin Tshirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshends 1985\u201386 band Deep End played two benefits at Brixton Academy in 1985 for DoubleO Charities.\n\nAmnesty International\nIn 1979 Townshend donated his services to the human rights organisation Amnesty International when he performed three songs for its benefit show The Secret Policemans Ball  performances that were released on record and seen in the film of the show. Townshends acoustic performances of three of his songs Pinball Wizard Drowned and Wont Get Fooled Again were subsequently cited as forerunners and inspiration for the unplugged phenomenon in the 1990sTownshend had been invited to perform for Amnesty by Martin Lewis the producer of The Secret Policemans Ball who stated later that Townshends participation had been the key to his securing the subsequent participation for Amnesty in the 1981 sequel show of Sting Eric Clapton Jeff Beck Phil Collins and Bob Geldof. Other performers inspired to support Amnesty International in future Secret Policemans Ball shows and other benefits because of Townshends early commitment to the organisation include Peter Gabriel Bruce Springsteen David Gilmour and U2's lead singer Bono who in 1986 told Rolling Stone magazine I saw The Secret Policemans Ball and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...\n\nDiscography\nSolo albums\nWho Came First 1972)\nRough Mix 1977) with Ronnie Lane\nEmpty Glass 1980)\nAll the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes 1982)\nWhite City A Novel 1985)\nThe Iron Man The Musical by Pete Townshend 1989)\nPsychoderelict 1993)Townshend also released several albums dedicated to his spiritual mentor Meher Baba listed on the discography page.\n\nGuest appearances\nIn 1968 Townshend helped assemble a band called Thunderclap Newman consisting of three musicians he knew pianist Andy Newman an old art school friend drummer John Speedy Keen who had written Armenia City in the Sky for the Who to record for their 1967 studio album The Who Sell Out and teenage guitarist Jimmy McCulloch later to join Wings. Townshend produced the band and played bass on their recordings under the tongueincheek pseudonym Bijou Drains. Their first recording was the single Something in the Air which became a number one hit in the UK and a substantial hit elsewhere in the world. Following this success Townshend produced their sole album Hollywood DreamIn 1971 Townshend along with Keith Moon and Ronnie Lane backed Mike Heron of the Incredible String Band on one song Warm Heart Pastry from Herons first solo LP Smiling Men with Bad Reputations.

He produced or coproduced often with Mike Portnoy before his initial departure from the band in 2010) all of Dream Theaters albums from Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory 1999) to A View from the Top of the World 2021) and has been the sole producer of the bands albums released since A Dramatic Turn of Events 2011). Petrucci has also released two solo albums Suspended Animation 2005) and Terminal Velocity 2020).\n\nEarly life and influences\nJohn Peter Petrucci was born on July 12, 1967, in Kings Park New York to an Italian American family. He picked up the guitar at around the age of eight because his older sister was allowed to go to bed later in order to practice the organ. However he decided to quit the guitar when his attempts to stay up late were unsuccessful. He picked up the guitar again at the age of 12. Petrucci has said he committed to practicing guitar six hours a day when he discovered it was his passion. His early influences were bands like Led Zeppelin Black Sabbath ACDC and later developed an interest in progressive rock and heavy metal exemplified by Rush Yes Iron Maiden Dixie Dregs and Metallica.\n\nCareer\nEventually his childhood friend and future Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore invited Petrucci to join his cover band. Petrucci attended Berklee College of Music in Boston with childhood friend John Myung bass where they met future bandmate Mike Portnoy drums. While in Berklee they often covered two of their biggest influences Iron Maiden and Rush. These three in addition to Kevin Moore formed the band Majesty. Because there was already another band with the same name the group later became Dream Theater.\nWhile Petrucci is most commonly associated with Dream Theater he is also in the project band Liquid Tension Experiment and has appeared as a guest on records by other artists such as the Age of Impact album by the Explorers Club.\nPetrucci has released a guitar instructional video Rock Discipline which covers warmup exercises exercises to avoid injury while playing alternate picking sweep picking chords and other techniques for developing ones guitar playing. Petrucci also has a book named Guitar World presents John Petruccis Wild Stringdom which was compiled from columns he wrote for Guitar World magazine under that title.\nIn 2001, Joe Satriani and Steve Vai invited Petrucci to tour with them on the popular G3 guitar tour which exposed him to a massive number of new fans and inspired a solo album. The album Suspended Animation was released on March 1, 2005, and was available for order from his web site. Petrucci also appeared on the 2005 and 2006 G3 tours and in 2007, went on G3 tour again this time with Paul Gilbert and Joe Satriani. In a video with Larry DiMarzio Petrucci announced that he is working on a followup to his 2005 album Suspended Animation and a new Dream Theater albumPetrucci also wrote and recorded two instrumental soundtrack songs for a Sega Saturn game titled Digital Pinball Necronomicon. Each track is roughly two minutes long and are named simply Prologue and Epilogue. In a spoof rock band Nightmare Cinema which was the Dream Theater members changing instruments for encores he used the alternate stage name Johnny James.\nIn 2012, Petrucci was invited once again to join Joe Satriani on the G3 tour along with Steve Morse. He was accompanied by bassist Dave LaRue and drummer and Dream Theater bandmate Mike Mangini.\nIn 2018, Petrucci joined Joe Satriani on the G3 tour. They were accompanied by Uli Jon Roth on the European leg of the tour and Phil Collen in North America. His second solo album titled Terminal Velocity was released in 2020. Petruccis first solo album in 15 years it reunited him with Mike Portnoy for the first time since the drummer left Dream Theater in 2010.\n\nMusical style\nGuitar technique\nPetrucci is respected for his variety of guitar styles and skills. One of the most notable of these is his highspeed alternate picking which as he himself claims requires a strong sense of synchronization between the two playing hands. He is notable for frequent use of the sevenstring electric guitar which he says he uses as a writing tool taking advantage of the extended range for heavier riffing and to play extended range runs as part of a solo. Moreover Petrucci often combines his metal shredding technique with a slower emotive soloing style. His influences as a guitarist include Jimmy Page Brian May Eddie Van Halen Steve Morse Al Di Meola Steve Howe Allan Holdsworth Stevie Ray Vaughan Randy Rhoads Joe Satriani Steve Vai Alex Lifeson Yngwie Malmsteen and David Gilmour.\n\nLyrics\nPetrucci is Dream Theaters most prolific lyricist with each album including at least three songs featuring his lyrics. Some of Petruccis notable songs include Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper The Spirit Carries On The Great Debate In the Presence of Enemies and Through Her Eyes. Petrucci has occasionally used reallife experiences for lyrical inspiration as heard in songs such as The Count of Tuscany A Nightmare to Remember and Endless Sacrifice.\n\nSinging\nPetrucci has acted as a backing vocalist live since the Awake Tour. He is a baritone producing a sound darker than that of James LaBries tenor voice. He has also written vocal melodies for Dream Theater. Petruccis role as a vocalist expanded following the departure of Mike Portnoy who had been Dream Theaters primary backing vocalist and occasionally even shared lead vocals with LaBrie. In live performances Petrucci now replicates some vocal parts originally sung by Portnoy with others being recorded samples.\n\nAccolades and praise\nRegarded as one of the most celebrated guitarists alive by Premier Guitar Petrucci has performed as the third guitarist on the G3 tour seven times more than any other invited guitarist. In their article John Petrucci The Ultimate Evolved Guitarist Premier Guitar calls Petrucci one of the best whos ever laid a hand on a fretboard. He was voted Best Prog guitarist by The Prog Magazine and the Greatest Guitarist by Burrn magazine and Mariskalrock. Guitar World magazine lists Petrucci among the Fastest Guitarists of All Time and calls him the most celebrated and popular guitarist in the world of progressive metal and arguably the most versatile and proficient player in his realm with a highly developed melodic sense and an alternate picking technique that is virtually untouchable as far as speed and precision while also ranking him among the top 5 Best Guitarists of the Decade.In 2019, Petrucci won the SENA Performers European Award. Joel McIvers 2009 book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists ranks Petrucci second after Dave Mustaine. He was also named as one of the Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time by GuitarOne magazine. In 2012, Petrucci was ranked the 17th greatest guitarist of all time by a Guitar World magazine readers poll. According to Forbes the Ernie BallMusic Man John Petrucci JP6 is the secondbestselling signature model of all time behind only the Gibson Les Paul.\n\nEquipment\nPetrucci is a longtime user of Music Man JP and Majesty series guitars and MesaBoogie amplifiers. While his pedalboard controller effects and overdrives have undergone changes over the years the core of Petruccis guitar sound remains DiMarzio pickups and MesaBoogie amplifiers. Most recently the signature JP2C amplifier based on the Mark IIC series and other Mark and Rectifier series amplifiers such as during the recording of Train of ThoughtA number of brands have released signature guitar equipment designed or endorsed by Petrucci \n\nIbanez released the first John Petrucci signature guitars made from 1995 to 1999\nDiMarzio have produced several pickups designed in collaboration with Petrucci and released a signature guitar strap bearing his emblem.\nErnie Ball Music Man USA began producing John Petrucci signature guitars in 2001 and have made numerous models bearing his name since.\nDunlop produce John Petrucci signature guitar picks including the Jazz III and flow\nTC Electronic released the Dreamscape John Petrucci signature modulation pedal in 2013At the beginning of 2016 two new releases were announced the Dunlop John Petrucci signature CryBaby wah and the MesaBoogie JP2C John Petrucci head.

He releases solo music under the name EOB.\nOBrien attended Abingdon School in Oxfordshire England where he formed Radiohead with schoolmates. OBrien said his role was to service the songs and support the songwriter Thom Yorke. He often creates ambient sounds and textures using effects sustain units and the EBow and provides backing vocals. \nOBriens first solo album Earth was released in 2020. OBrien had been writing songs for years but lacked confidence and felt they had a character that would be lost with Radiohead. He began a North American tour in February 2020; a larger tour was cancelled due to the COVID19 pandemic.\nRolling Stone named OBrien among the greatest guitarists of all time in 2010 and 2023. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Radiohead in 2019.\n\nEarly life\nOBrien was born on April 15, 1968. His family comes from Ballyporeen Ireland. As a child OBrien enjoyed cricket and theatre. His parents split when he was 10; OBrien said this was when music became his refuge. He grew up listening to postpunk acts such as Siouxsie and the Banshees Adam and the Ants Depeche Mode the Police and David Bowie. He said It was a very foetal time for music because people who went to art college or artists or musicians suddenly thought Oh I can be that.The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School an independent school for boys in Abingdon Oxfordshire. While OBrien was playing Lysander in a school production of A Midsummer Nights Dream he met Thom Yorke who was scoring the production. Yorke asked him to join him for a jam. According to OBrien Before that life was a bit confusing a bit crap. And then suddenly ... I felt something very strong almost like some kind of epiphany almost like This is it.Along with the drummer Philip Selway OBrien was in the year above Yorke and the bassist Colin Greenwood and three years above Colins brother the guitarist Jonny Greenwood. In 1985, they formed On a Friday the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the schools music room. They continued to rehearse during holidays while the members attended university. OBrien studied economics at the University of Manchester where he took part in the Second Summer of Love.\n\nCareer\nRadiohead\nIn 1991, On a Friday signed a record contract with EMI and changed their name to Radiohead. They found early success with their debut single Creep from their debut album Pablo Honey 1993). Whereas initially all three guitarists often played identical parts for their second album The Bends 1995) their roles were more divided with Yorke generally playing rhythm Greenwood lead and Ed OBrien providing effects. The Bends received positive reviews and elevated Radioheads profileRadioheads third album OK Computer 1997) brought them international fame and is often acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time. OK Computer saw OBrien use less distortion and more delay and other effects creating a sound that was more about textures. OBrien became depressed during the extensive OK Computer tour but focused on supporting Yorke. After the tour he returned to Oxford used large amounts of drugs and fell further into depression. He said I was single on my own  I was the lowest Ive ever been. It was the irony as well  youre at the top that old clich\u00e9.Radioheads next albums Kid A 2000) and Amnesiac 2001) marked a dramatic change in sound incorporating influences from electronic music classical music jazz and krautrock. OBrien initially struggled with the change saying Its scary  everyone feels insecure. Im a guitarist and suddenly its like well there are no guitars on this track or no drums. He began using effects units more extensively to process his guitar creating create synthesiserlike sounds. OBrien kept an online diary of Radioheads progress during the recordingDuring the sessions for In Rainbows 2007) OBrien believed Radiohead might never record another album. He said later One of my mantras throughout the recording was This is the last time Im doing this. Ill never summon up the energy to do this again. So Im going to put everything I can into it. He was motivated by a desire to cement Radioheads status as a great band and said in 2008: In my view weve made three really great records The Bends OK Computer and Kid A. What we needed was another great record just to seal it.By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2019; OBrien and Selway attended the induction ceremony and gave speeches. OBrien thanked his bandmates for their musicianship and friendship saying that some of the nights we have in the rehearsal studio are like transcendental moments.In 2020, OBrien said his role in Radiohead was to service the songs and support Yorke. He said Ive always been like his older brother ... I always say that he was like the dad of the band and Im the mum. My job was to always put my arm around him and his job was to be Thom. Radioheads producer Nigel Godrich described OBrien as very much a diplomat.\n\nSolo work\nOBrien releases solo music under the name EOB. After making demos with the producer Ian Davenport in 2014, he recorded with the producer Flood from late 2017 to early 2019. His first solo track the ambient composition Santa Teresa was released on 4 October 2019. He had written songs for years but lacked the confidence to bring them to Radiohead and felt they had a distinct energy that would be lost if they became a hybrid product.OBriens debut solo album Earth was released on 17 April 2020 on Capitol Records to positive reviews. It features the drummer Omar Hakim the Invisible members Nathan East and Dave Okumu the folk singer Laura Marling the Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley the Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche and the Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood. The music was inspired by OBriens time living in Brazil and attending Carnival which he described as a musical eureka moment. The first track Brasil was released on 5 December 2019, followed by ShangriLa on 6 February. OBrien began a North American tour in February 2020; a larger Earth tour was cancelled due to the COVID19 pandemicOBrien contributed a remix of Paul McCartneys song Slidin to the 2021 remix album McCartney III Imagined. In January 2024, OBrien said he was deep into recording his second album.\n\nOther work\nIn 1999, OBrien contributed to the soundtrack for the BBC drama series Eureka Street. He contributed guitar to the 2003 Asian Dub Foundation album Enemy of the Enemy. OBrien and Selway toured and recorded with Neil Finn as part of the 7 Worlds Collide project. OBrien provided guitar and backing vocals on their 2001 live album and the 2009 studio album The Sun Came OutOBrien is a founding director of the Featured Artists Coalition a nonprofit organisation set up to protect the rights of featured musical artists particularly in the digital age. He appeared in a 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 5 Live sports programme Fighting Talk in support of Record Shop Day. In 2013, OBrien cofounded the Laundry a workspace restaurant and nightclub converted from a laundry in London Fields. In 2019, Hackney Council announced that the building would be demolished to make way for luxury flatsIn 2014, OBrien and Selway signed an open letter protesting a ban on guitars in British prisons and stating that music was important for rehabilitation. OBrien worked with Fender to design a signature model guitar the EOB Stratocaster which went on sale in November 2017. It features a tremolo bridge and a sustainer neck pickup. In 2018, he became an informal patron for the environmental pressure group Extinction Rebellion which he described as incredibly enlightened.In 2019, OBrien joined the RSPB Let Nature Sing project which aimed to get birdsong into the UK charts to raise awareness of the decline in Britains birdlife. In 2020, OBrien contributed to Ear Opener an online video course aimed at helping young people write music. That November he gave evidence to a DCMS Committee inquiry into the impact of streaming on the music industry. He said he wanted to speak for less successful artists who he felt were exploited.\n\nMusicianship\nOBrien said of his playing I literally learned to play my instrument within the band so I started off very limited  and Im still very limited. But Ive been lucky because Ive been in a band that has not required you to be a virtuoso. OBrien also sings backing vocals which Pitchfork described as Radioheads most consistent secret weapon.While Jonny Greenwood plays most of Radioheads lead guitar parts OBrien often creates ambient effects making extensive use of effects units. He said of the technique Its a bit like youre creating a canvas. That would be in accompaniment with Thom playing chords on the piano  youre building up a cloud of effects behind.OBrien usually plays Fender Stratocasters including an Eric Clapton Stratocaster. He also plays Gretsch and Rickenbacker guitars including a twelvestring Rickenbacker. OBrien said in 2017 that his most used effects are distortion an ElectroHarmonix Memory Man delay and a DigiTech Whammy pitch shifter. He described the Boss DD5 delay pedal as key to the sound of The Bends and OK Computer ... Its the only delay that can make those OK Computer sounds. In the Kid A sessions at the suggestion of Michael Brook the creator of the Infinite Guitar OBrien began using sustain units which allow guitar notes to be sustained indefinitely. He combined these with looping and delay effects to create synthesiserlike soundsTo create the highpitched chiming sound that introduces Lucky OBrien strums above the guitar nut. He creates the reverberating pops on the introduction of 2  2  5\". On Karma Police OBrien distorts his guitar by driving a delay effect to selfoscillation then lowering the delay rate creating a melting effect. The ambient track Treefingers was created by processing OBriens guitar loops. On Dollars and Cents OBrien uses a pitch shifter pedal to shift his guitar chords from minor to major. For All I Need he used a sustain unit and a guitar strung with four bottom E strings creating a thicker sound. OBrien uses the EBow an electronic sustaining device on his guitar to generate drones and ambient leads on songs such as My Iron Lung Talk Show Host Jigsaw Falling Into Place Where I End and You Begin and Nude. On The King of Limbs and A Moon Shaped Pool he used a Klon Centaur overdrive pedalIn 2010, the Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke named OBrien the 59thgreatest guitarist of all time. In 2023, Rolling Stone named OBrien and Greenwood the joint 43rdgreatest guitarists writing that OBrien was possibly the most underrated guitarist in rock ... adding subtle textures that enhance each song and keeping the band grounded with his cheerful upforanything vibe. You might not be able to name his best solo but its impossible to imagine Radiohead without him.\n\nInfluences\nOBriens earliest guitar influence was Andy Summers of the Police particularly his use of delay and chorus effects on Walking on the Moon. His other influences include Peter Buck of REM Paul Weller of the Jam Johnny Marr of the Smiths John McGeoch of Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Edge of U2. OBrien admired how these guitarists created space rather than playing conventional solos. He said They were great guitarists but they werent lead guitarists ... My favourite guitarists know when not to play. Then you make more of it when you do play. Make it count. OBrien cited the American band Phish as an influence saying Theyre like a jazz band they are willing to take risks for a moment of musical transcendence. Thats what Im after  I want to tap into that.\n\nPersonal life\nOBrien lives in north London. With his wife Susan Kobrin he has a son born in January 2004, and a daughter born in 2006. OBrien is a cricket fan and supports Brentford FC. Around 2000, he gave up alcohol saying it was fucking him up and took up meditation. In 2011, OBrien and his family moved to Brazil for a year living on a farm near Ubatuba. In March 2020, OBrien announced that he had contracted COVID19 and was recovering in isolation.\n\nSolo discography\nStudio albums\nSingles\nSee also\nList of Old Abingdonians\n\nReferences\nNotes\nRandall Mac 2000). Exit Music The Radiohead Story. Omnibus Press. ISBN 0-385-33393-5.", "Aaron Wright North born March 22, 1979) is an American musician. He was the cofounder and guitarist of punk band The Icarus Line a touring lead guitarist of industrial rock group Nine Inch Nails and vocalistguitarist for Jubilee. North is noted for his chaotic and unconventional guitar approach his use and command of feedback and the flailing of his guitar wildly while on stage.\nHis reputation for being outspoken both on and off the stage resulted in equal criticism and praise from fans and music journalists mainly due to his role as cofounder and owner of Buddyhead. More infamously it also landed him in substantial legal trouble numerous times. The Buddyhead music website was an outlet for his ruthlessly opinionated writing as well as the many notable interviews he conducted with the likes of Kevin Shields and Greg Ginn.\nNorths creation of Buddyhead Records later extended to his recording and producing many of their bands. Among the groups he signed or issued releases from were At the DriveIn Ink  Dagger and The Dillinger Escape Plan.\nIn 2008, North found himself frustrated and disappointed about the creative direction of Jubilee and felt a growing discomfort with his business partner in Buddyhead. As a result by 2009 Aaron had ceased involvement with both groups.\n\nRecording career\n1998\u20132004: The Icarus Line\nNorth was one of the original members of The Icarus Line and toured and recorded with the group as a guitarist between 1998 and 2004. During his time with the band they released two critically acclaimed studio albums Mono in 2001 and Penance Soiree in 2004) and three EPs Highlypuncturingnoisetestingyourabilitytohate and Red And Black Attack  in 1998 and Three Jesus Songs in 2003). The band was known for its chaotic live performances including a notorious incident in 2002 when during a performance at the Hard Rock Cafe in Austin Texas North liberated a guitar that had belonged to Stevie Ray Vaughan by breaking its protective case with the base of a microphone stand. He tried plugging it into his amplifier but was then quickly set upon by security. The incident resulted in North receiving numerous death threats from outraged Texans and legal troubles. North quit the band abruptly in 2004, citing a desire to move into a new direction musically.\n\n2005\u20132007: Nine Inch Nails\nNorth joined Nine Inch Nails in 2005 as the lead guitarist in a lineup that featured drummer Jerome Dillon former A Perfect Circle and Marilyn Manson bass player Jeordie White and keyboard player Alessandro Cortini. He has stated that the invitation resulted from a recommendation to band leader Trent Reznor by producer Alan Moulder who had worked with both The Icarus Line and Nine Inch Nails. In The New Zealand Herald Reznor described the first time North jammed with Nine Inch Nails\n\nHe shows up he looks shitty hes got junk equipment he looks like hes just got up and I want to punch him. And then Aaron starts playing and on the first note its like Youre the guy. He wasnt trying to be me and play like I play. He played and chaos came out. It immediately made the band turn into something else.\nNorth was with the band for the Live With_Teeth tour in support of the 2005 release With Teeth and the Performance 2007\" tour the latter stages of which were in support of the 2007 release Year Zero. While touring with NIN in 2005 North performed as a guest guitarist with the band Queens of the Stone Age at various acoustic instore performances and two regular shows in Los Angeles. In July 2006, North was named along with Nine Inch Nails in a lawsuit brought on by Wisconsin security guard Mark LaVoie. This suit alleged that he intentionally and violently inflicted injury upon the guard while performing at Alliant Energy Center on Oct. 13, 2005. The lawsuit reportedly settled out of court with LaVoie receiving a substantial amount of moneyNorth is included on the live DVD Beside You in Time and appeared in the music videos for The Hand That Feeds and Survivalism. He left the group at the conclusion of the 2007 run.\n\n2007\u20132008: Jubilee\nNorth formed Jubilee in late 2007 with former Icarus Line bandmate Troy Petrey on drums and bassist Michael Shuman Queens of the Stone Age Wires On Fire. The band embarked on a brief UK tour in January 2008 with members of Wires On Fire temporarily rounding out the lineup. The band returned to the UK in late 2008 to complete a more extensive tour. Upon their return they played one show in Los Angeles. This is still the only performance the band has ever played in their native country. Jubilee released two singles in 2008, Rebel Hiss and In With The Out Crowd which were intended to be immediately followed by their debut album.\nIn late 2008, North attempted to form a new lineup of the band and finish the album but eventually abandoned both due to frustrations around the creative direction of the band. The still unreleased album includes performances from a vast array of drummers and collaborators including Dave Grohl Julian Gross Nick Jago Joey Castillo Carla Azar Josh Freese Loren Humphrey Kevin Haskins Taylor Hawkins Josh Homme Trent Reznor and Maynard James Keenan.\n\nBuddyhead\nAaron North cofounded Buddyhead with Travis Keller in 1998. The independent record label and music webzine was infamous for its gossip section that frequently featured phone numbers of celebrities such as Fred Durst and Courtney Love. The gossip section also frequently slammed Axl Rose of Guns N Roses. Buddyhead was also known for their infamous antics such as spraypainting uckin Dick on the tour bus of The Strokes as well as breaking into the Interscope Records building to steal three of Dursts baseball caps. North ended his association with Buddyhead in 2008 due to discomfort with his business partner.\n\nMusical equipment\nMany other guitars effects and amplifiers have been used by North in his various projects these are only a few of the confirmed pedals that he is currently or has used in the past.\n\nGuitars\nEffects\nAmplifiersMarshall 1959HW Plexi\nAmpeg V4\nMesa Boogie Custom 150 watt Racktifier Heads\nFender Twin Reverb\n\nDiscography\nWith The Icarus LineHighlypuncturingnoisetestingyourabilitytohate  EP 1998)\nRed And Black Attack  EP 1998)\nThree Jesus Songs  EP 2003)\nMono  Album 2001)\nPenance Soiree  Album 2004)\nKill Cupid With A Nail File  Single 2000)\nFeed A Cat To Your Cobra  Single 2001)\nLove Is Happiness  Single 2003)\nUp Against The Wall Motherfuckers  Single 2004)\nParty The Baby Off  Single 2004)\nOn The Lash  Single 2004)\nw Ink  Dagger Were Never Gonna Make It  Split Album 1998)\nw Burning Brides Angelfuck  Split Album 2002)With Nine Inch NailsThe Hand That Feeds  Music Video 2005)\nBeside You In Time  Live DVD 2007)\nSurvivalism  Music Video 2007)With JubileeRebel Hiss  Single 2008)\nIn With The Out Crowd  Single 2008)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nNine Inch Nails\nAaron North at The Nine Inch Nails Wiki", "Steve J. Morse born July 28, 1954) is an American guitarist best known as the founder of the Dixie Dregs and as the guitarist for Deep Purple from 1994 to 2022. Morse has also enjoyed a successful solo career and was briefly a member of the group Kansas in the mid1980s.  Most recently Morse became a member of the supergroup Flying Colors.\n\nEarly life and education\nSteve Morse was born in Hamilton Ohio. His family soon moved to Tennessee and then to Ypsilanti Michigan where Morse spent his childhood. Although familiar with piano and clarinet Morse ultimately became a guitarist.\nMorse worked briefly with his older brother Dave in a band called the Plague until the family moved to Augusta Georgia. In the late 1960s he played in a band called Three with his older brother and a junior high schoolmate William Gerald Jerry Wooten who played keyboards. The three performed at a local psychedelic youth club the Glass Onion and at Legion Halls and church functions.\nWhile enrolled in the Academy of Richmond County Morse met bassist Andy West and together they formed the Dixie Grit adding keyboardist Johnny Carr and guitarist and vocalist Frank Brittingham with Dave Morse drumming. This shortlived group played material from groups such as Led Zeppelin and Cream. West and Morse continued to play as a duet billed as the Dixie Dregs until Morses expulsion from school in the 10th grade for refusing to cut his hair.\nSteve completed 11th grade at a local Catholic school and was eligible for early college enrollment. He enrolled at the University of Miami School of Music. \nDuring the 1970s the University of Miami played host to a number of future influential musicians including Bruce Hornsby Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorius. Andy West also enrolled at the University of Miami and with Morse drummer Bart Yarnold keyboardist Frank Josephs and violinist Allen Sloan collaborated in a lab project entitled Rock Ensemble II. In 1975, the group compiled a recording used for promotional efforts. It was originally released on vinyl in 1976, and again on CD in 1997 as The Great Spectacular.\nFrom late 1987 to early 1988, Morse worked as a commercial airline copilot. He has lived in Ocala Florida since 1991, where he is involved in hay farming.\n\nDixie Dregs\nUpon Morses graduation from the University of Miami in 1975, he and West officially named their group Dixie Dregs. A fellow University of Miami alumnus Rod Morgenstein replaced the injured Bart Yarnold and the band began performing regularly with some of their own compositions along with material by John McLaughlin and southern rock favorites.  An increasingly heavier performance schedule eventually led to the attention of Capricorn Records recruiters including Allman Brothers Band manager Twiggs Lyndon and in late 1976, the group was signed by the southern rock labelTheir first effort for Capricorn Free Fall established Morse as an important newcomer to the fusion genre and he was recognized for both his compositional skills having written all 11 tracks and his musicianship. Although receiving positive reviews as a pivotal jazz fusion album it sold poorly.\nWhat If was released in 1978.  Writing credits were more collaborative and the bands sound had matured into more than what was strictly considered fusion at the time. Southern rock classical folk and country elements were combined to form a cohesive and listenable music. Though supported by a tour record sales remained flat but gained Morse and the band an invitation to perform at Montreux Jazz Festival on July 23, 1978. Four songs from the recorded performance were released the following year on Night of the Living Dregs. Capricorn went bankrupt in late 1979, and the Dixie Dregs were left without a label.\nArista Records signed the band in 1979 to record three albums. Production control was handed to Morse and Dregs of the Earth was released in May 1980. All eight tracks were written by Morse and the album peaked at number 27 on Billboards Jazz Album Chart.\nArista became increasingly concerned about Dixie Dregs album sales and pressured the band to change their name to simply the Dregs in an attempt to increase the bands visibility in the public eye. Unsung Heroes included seven new Morse compositions plus a shortened rearrangement of Cruise Control in early 1981, but the name change did little to address Aristas worries. The Dregs felt compelled by label management to add lyrics to their next release appropriately titled Industry Standard.\nMorses compositions on Industry Standard began to sound more like his evolving solo work than Dregs collaborations and the album received critical and public praise. Industry Standard was voted Best Guitar LP by readers of Guitar Player magazine in their annual readers poll that year. Additionally Morse was voted Best Overall Guitarist in the same poll an honor that he would hold for five consecutive years which ended his eligibility by retiring him into their Gallery of Greats a distinction shared only by Steve Howe of Yes and Eric Johnson. After fulfilling their commitment to Arista the Dregs members who had tired of touring disbanded in early 1983.\nIn the late 1980s the group reunited for a tour featuring former members Morse Morgenstein Lavitz and Sloan. Their return was complemented by a Best Of release entitled Divided We Stand. Bassist Dave LaRue completed the lineup for a seven date tour culminating in the 1992 live album Bring em Back Alive. Violinist Jerry Goodman of the Mahavishnu Orchestra fame filled in for Sloan who was frequently absent as a result of his medical career. They signed a deal with former label Capricorn Records for their first studio album in years entitled Full Circle in 1994.\n\nSteve Morse Band and Kansas\nAfter the 1983 breakup of the Dregs Morse then formed the Steve Morse Band a trio with bassist Jerry Peek and drummer Doug Morgan formerly a member of Glass Moon. After the first tour of the eastern United States Morgan left for previous commitments the choice to replace Morgan was Rod Morgenstein. They began recording The Introduction in September which included British country guitarist Albert Lee making a guest appearance on the track General Lee. The group toured Germany in early 1984 with Morse conducting clinics and the group was signed by Elektra Records who released The Introduction midyear. A second German tour began in December 1984 and Stand Up was released in 1985. This effort included guest vocalists and guitarists Eric Johnson Alex Ligertwood Peter Frampton Albert Lee Van Temple and violinist Mark OConnor. He toured with Rush as a main opener on their Power Windows tour.\nIn 1986, Morse joined the rock group Kansas. During his time with the band they released two albums Power and In the Spirit of Things. While he was with the band Kansas had its last big hit All I Wanted which reached the Billboard Top 20 and on which Morse received cowriting credit. Morse left the band after touring behind the latter album. He rejoined the band for part of its 1991 tour.\nFollowing this Morse resumed the Steve Morse Band with new personnel bassist Dave LaRue and drummer Van Romaine and has released several further recordings even after joining Deep Purple.\n\nDeep Purple\nIn 1994, Morse joined the British hard rock group Deep Purple replacing Ritchie Blackmore after Joe Satriani had initially replaced Blackmore on a temporary basis for the final leg of The Battle Rages On tour in Japan and European dates the following summer. With 28 years as a member of the band Morse was their longestserving guitarist and played on eight studio albums with them between 1996's Purpendicular and 2021's Turning to Crime and appeared on several live albums.\nHis departure from Deep Purple was announced on 23 July 2022, and driven by the illness of his wife Janine.\n\nLiving Loud\nIn addition to playing with Deep Purple Morse together with Jimmy Barnes Bob Daisley Lee Kerslake and Don Airey formed Living Loud in 2003. The group released one studio album and a live DVD in 2004/2005. In Spring 2010 it was reported that Steve Morse and Bob Daisley started work on a new studio album which was set for a release in 2011, but nothing came of this.\n\nAngelfire\nMorse began a collaboration with singer Sarah Spencer in 2007 entitled Angelfire. The album of the same name was released on August 10, 2010, on Radiant Records. The album features Dave LaRue and Van Romaine of the Steve Morse Band on bass and drums respectively. The album has a textural acoustic sound that differs from Morses previous work. Angelfire opened for the Steve Morse Band for several shows in California January and Florida March of 2010.\n\nFlying Colors\nIn 2011, Morse joined Flying Colors an American supergroup composed of Mike Portnoy Dave LaRue Casey McPherson and Neal Morse whose debut eponymous album was released on March 26, 2012, and debuted at No. 9 on Billboards Hard Rock chart and No. 11 on the BBCs Rock Album charts. Flying Colors released its second album Second Nature in 2014, and third album Third Degree in 2019, both to critical acclaim.\n\nG3\nIn 2012 Steve Morse joined G3 project on their South American and European tour togerher with Steve Vai John Petrucci and Joe Satriani.\n\nInfluence and technique\nMorse is considered one of the hardest working guitarists in the world. He is widely known for his stylistically diverse compositional skills and was voted Best Overall Guitarist by Guitar Player magazine for five years in a row qualifying him for its Guitar Player Hall of Fame the only other members being Steve Howe of Yes and Eric Johnson. He is regularly cited by John Petrucci as a major influence.  Guitarist Shawn Lane regarded Steve Morse as one of the most talented guitarists of his time. Ritchie Blackmore who preceded Morse in Deep Purple has stated Steve Morse is an incredible player. A lot of people try to get some wisecrack out of me but when youre talking about guitar players along Morses caliber theyre brilliant. Morse has proven himself throughout his career as capable of playing highly complex chord structures in classical sequences as well as being able to play fast alternate picked arpeggios. He is well known for using harmonics and improvising them in songs during live performances such as in Deep Purples Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming.\n\nGear and equipment\nGuitars\nThroughout the 1980s Morse was using a custom Frankentele guitar made up of a Tele body with a Strat neck a Gibson trapezestyle tailpiece coming from a twelve string guitar and four pickups in HSSH configuration. At one time the guitar had a fifth pickup a hexaphonic pickup with a separate output for each string it provided the signal to drive a 360 Systems Spectre guitar synthesizerMorse worked with Music Man Guitars to create two signature models a modernized version of Morses first Frankenstein Telecaster guitar Steve Morse Signature and the Steve Morse SM Y2D is an updated version with quilted maple top.\n\nPickups\nMorse has released two signature humbuckers with DiMarzio the DP 205 Neck model and the DP 200 Bridge model. They are evenly balanced to allow playing all over the fretboard since Morse plays high notes on the neck pickup and low ones on the bridge. They are the main pickups into his signature model. Dimarzio also wires a custom wound single coil pickup for Music Man to use into the SM signature model.\n\nAmplification\nMorse is an endorser of ENGL amps. He has released a signature model the ENGL E656 Steve Morse signature amplifier. It is a three channel amp specially designed by Morse with a custom version of the famous ENGL midrange matrix. In the past he used Peavey 5150 amps with Deep Purple Marshall Jubilee Peavey VTM 120 and Ampeg V4.\n\nLive setup\nMorses live equipment includes two ENGL E 656 Signature heads and several Music Man guitars both models his 1 still being his favorite. He splits up his signal to six different cabinets four dry without any FX and two wet with FX. He uses three Ernie Ball expression pedals to blend the fx into the mix. He uses a custom Skrydstrup RD switching system to perform all the switching and the blending. His FX are very simple consisting only of a Boss OC3 Octaver and two delays ElectroHarmonix Memory Man now replaced with the newest TC Electronic FlashBack TonePrint delay Morse has created custom presets. He is also using a TC Electronic Polytune Mini guitar tuner.\nHis live setup for Deep Purple is discussed by him for Premier Guitar magazines Rig Rundown.\n\nDiscography\nWith Dixie Dregs\nWith Deep Purple\nSolo and with other bands\nGuest appearances with other artists\n1977 Tropical Nights  Liza Minnelli\n1979 Evening Pastoral  Rob Cassels Band\n1980 SchemerDreamer  Steve Walsh Guest electric guitar on Wait Until Tomorrow\n1981 I Wonder How Does Tarzan ShaveCool In The Movies  Patrick Walsh\n1982 Dixie Dregs demos  Fiona Flanagan unreleased\n1983 Kamikazee Christian  Rob Cassels Band\n1983 Art In America  Art in America\n1983 The Touch Sonny Turner\n1986 Storytime  T Lavitz\n1987 Stone From Which The Arch Was Made  Mark OConnor\n1987 Surveillance  Triumph All the Kings Horses and Headed for Nowhere\n1988 Southern By The Grace Of God Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987  Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitar on Gimme Back My Bullets\n1988 Love Your Man  The Rossington Band\n1990 Nashville RendezVous  Marcel Dadi\n1991 Fingers Crossing  Marcel Dadi\n1992 Country Guitar Flavors  Marcel Dadi\n1992 Lone Ranger  Jeff Watson Guitar solo on Talking Hands\n1993 Coven Pitrelli OReilly  CPR\n1994 Thonk  Michael Manring\n1995 Carmine Appices Guitar Zeus  Carmine Appice\n1996 Dick Pimple Present Music From Turtle Island Deep Purple in disguise\n1996 Signatures  Kevin Crider\n1997 Storm  Torden  Lyn\n2001 Seventh Key  Seventh Key No Mans Land and Every Time It Rains\n2001 Nylon  Steel  Manuel Barrueco\n2001 Feeding the Wheel  Jordan Rudess Solos on Quantum Soup and Crack the Meter\n2001 Pavarotti  Friends For Afghanistan  Luciano Pavarotti Smoke on the Water with Deep Purple\n2002 Camino LatinoLatin Journey  Liona Boyd\n2004 Rhythm of Time  Jordan Rudess Bar Hopping with Mr. Picky and What Four\n2005 Guitar Farm  Steve Woolverton\n2006 Gillans Inn  Ian Gillan\n2006 II  Deacon Street\n2007 School of the Arts  School Of The Arts On Fire and Portrait\n2008 Porta San Gennaro Napoli  Mario Fasciano  Rick Wakeman  Steve Morse  Ian Paice  Don Airey  Rob Townsend\n2008 Brian Tarquin Presents..

One of the most successful composers and performers of all time McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bassplaying versatile and wide tenor vocal range and musical eclecticism exploring genres ranging from prerock and roll pop to classical ballads and electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most successful in modern music historyBorn in Liverpool McCartney taught himself piano guitar and songwriting as a teenager having been influenced by his father a jazz player and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennons skiffle group the Quarrymen in 1957, which eventually evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called the cute Beatle McCartney later immersed himself in the London avantgarde scene and played a key role in incorporating experimental aesthetics into the Beatles studio productions. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band he gradually became the bands de facto leader providing creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs including And I Love Her Yesterday Eleanor Rigby and Blackbird rank among the most covered songs in history. Although primarily a bassist with the Beatles he played a number of other instruments including keyboards guitars and drums on various songs.\nAfter the Beatles disbanded he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album McCartney and went on to form the band Wings with his first wife Linda and Denny Laine. Under McCartneys leadership Wings became one of the most successful bands of the 1970s. He wrote or cowrote their US or UK numberone hits such as My Love Band on the Run Listen to What the Man Said Silly Love Songs and Mull of Kintyre. He resumed his solo career in 1980 and has been touring as a solo artist since 1989. Apart from Wings his UK or US numberone hits include Uncle AlbertAdmiral Halsey with Linda Coming Up Pipes of Peace Ebony and Ivory with Stevie Wonder and Say Say Say with Michael Jackson. Beyond music he has been involved in projects to promote international charities related to animal rights seal hunting land mines vegetarianism poverty and music education.\nMcCartney has written or cowritten a record 32 songs that have topped the Billboard Hot 100 and as of 2009, he had sales of 255 million RIAAcertified units in the US. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999) an Academy Award a Primetime Emmy Award 18 Grammy Awards an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965, and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world with an estimated fortune of 800 million.\n\nEarly life\nMcCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool where his mother Mary Patricia n\u00e9e Mohin had qualified to practise as a nurse. Both of his parents were of Irish descent. McCartney has a younger brother Peter Michael and a younger stepsister Ruth born to his father Jims second wife Angie during her first marriage. Paul and Michael were baptised in their mothers Catholic faith even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the householdAccording to his biographer Peter Ames Carlin McCartneys parents came from the lowest rungs of the working class but had experienced some upward social mobility during their lifetimes. Before the war Jim had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co having been promoted from his job as a sample boy in their warehouse when the war broke out Hannays was shuttered and Jim was employed as a lathe turner at Napiers defence engineering works volunteering for the fire brigade at night. The growing family was rehoused at a flat in Knowsley in 1944 and then in a council housing development in Speke in 1946. After the war Jim returned to his job at the cotton merchants with a reduced income. Marys work as a visiting midwife was much more remunerativeMcCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, he was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the 11-Plus exam meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends McCartney later admitted I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\n\nMary McCartneys midwifery paid well and her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton where they lived until 1964. She rode a bicycle to her patients McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at about three in the morning the streets ... thick with snow. On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was 14, his mother died of an embolism as a complication of surgery for breast cancer. McCartneys loss later became a connection with John Lennon whose mother Julia died in 1958 when Lennon was 17McCartneys father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Macs Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room encouraged his sons to be musical and advised McCartney to take piano lessons. However McCartney preferred to learn by ear. When McCartney was 11, his father encouraged him to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir but he was not accepted. McCartney then joined the choir at St Barnabas Church Mossley Hill. McCartney received a nickelplated trumpet from his father for his fourteenth birthday but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg McCartney traded it for a 15 Framus Zenith model 17) acoustic guitar since he wanted to be able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar righthanded but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played lefthanded he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song I Lost My Little Girl on the Zenith and composed another early tune that would become When Im SixtyFour on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol Long Tall Sally was the first song McCartney performed in public at a Butlins Filey holiday camp talent competition.\n\nCareer\n1957\u20131960: The Quarrymen\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band the Quarrymen at the St Peters Church Hall f\u00eate in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle a type of popular music with jazz blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist followed by Lennons art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass in 1960. By May 1960, the band had tried several names including Johnny and the Moondogs Beatals and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a fiveengagement residency in Hamburg.\n\n1960\u20131970: The Beatles\nIn 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney became their bass player. It is disputed whether he did so reluctantly or actively sought out the role. While in Hamburg they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single My Bonnie. This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August and the band had their first hit Love Me Do in October becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as Beatlemania and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the cute Beatle. McCartney cowrote with Lennon several of their early hits including I Saw Her Standing There She Loves You I Want to Hold Your Hand 1963) and Cant Buy Me Love 1964).In August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition Yesterday featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP the song was the groups first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. Yesterday became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote from 1965] ... McCartney would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter but also as instrumentalist arranger producer and de facto musical director of the Beatles. Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the bands music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song In My Life. McCartney said of the album wed had our cute period and now it was time to expand. Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... and as far as Paul was concerned George Harrison could do no rightPaul was absolutely finicky.In 1966, the Beatles released the album Revolver. Featuring sophisticated lyrics studio experimentation and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The first of three consecutive McCartney Asides the single Paperback Writer preceded the LPs release. The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song and another for its Bside Rain. The films described by Harrison as the forerunner of videos aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966. Revolver also included McCartneys Eleanor Rigby which featured a string octet. According to Gould the song is a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song. Except for some backing vocals the song included only McCartneys lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.\nThe band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour. Later that year McCartney completed his first musical project independent of the groupa film score for the UK production The Family Way. The score was a collaboration with Martin who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations. The soundtrack failed to chart but it won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental ThemeUpon the end of the Beatles performing career McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project which became Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band widely regarded as rocks first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the albums title track. As McCartney explained We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little moptop approach. We were not boys we were men ... and we thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers.Starting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album. Their recording of A Day in the Life required a fortypiece orchestra which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double Aside single Strawberry Fields ForeverPenny Lane in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. Based on an ink drawing by McCartney the LPs cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band standing with a host of celebrities. The cover piqued a frenzy of analysis.\n\nEpsteins death in August 1967 created a void which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future. McCartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of the group that Lennon had once led. In his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership McCartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television which was to become Magical Mystery Tour. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn the project was an administrative nightmare throughout. McCartney largely directed the film which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response. However the films soundtrack was more successful. It was released in the UK as a sixtrack double extended play disc EP and as an identically titled LP in the US filled out with five songs from the bands recent singles. The only Capitol compilation later included in the groups official canon of studio albums the Magical Mystery Tour LP achieved 8 million in sales within three weeks of its release higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that pointThe Beatles animated film Yellow Submarine loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartneys 1966 composition premiered in July 1968. Though critics admired the film for its visual style humour and music the soundtrack album issued six months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their eponymous double album also known as the White Album. Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group Weve been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away ... we were always fighting his discipline a bit but its silly to fight that discipline if its our own.In March 1969, McCartney married his first wife Linda Eastman and in August the couple had their first child Mary named after his late mother. Abbey Road was the bands last recorded album and Martin suggested a continuously moving piece of music urging the group to think symphonically. McCartney agreed but Lennon did not. They eventually compromised agreeing to McCartneys suggestion an LP featuring individual songs on side one and a long medley on side two. In October 1969, a rumour surfaced that McCartney had died in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike but this was quickly refuted when a November Life magazine cover featured him and his family accompanied by the caption Paul is still with us.John Lennon privately left the Beatles in September 1969, though agreed not to go public with the information to not jeopardise ongoing business negotiations. McCartney was in the midst of business disagreements with his bandmates largely concerning Allen Kleins management of the group when he announced his own departure from the group on 10 April 1970. He filed a suit for the bands formal dissolution on 31 December 1970, and in March 1971 the court appointed a receiver to oversee the finances of the Beatles company Apple Corps. An English court legally dissolved the Beatles partnership on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company EMI Klein and each other persisted until 1989.\n\n1970\u20131981: Wings\nAs the Beatles were breaking up in 1969\u201370, McCartney fell into a depression. His wife helped him pull out of that condition by praising his work as a songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour he wrote Maybe Im Amazed explaining that with the Beatles breaking up that was my feeling Maybe Im amazed at whats going on ... Maybe Im a man and maybe youre the only woman who could ever help me Baby wont you help me understand ... Maybe Im amazed at the way you pulled me out of time hung me on the line Maybe Im amazed at the way I really need you. He added that every love song I write is for Linda.In 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release McCartney a US numberone album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda McCartney is a oneman album with McCartney providing compositions instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album Ram. A UK number one and a US top five Ram included the cowritten US numberone hit single Uncle AlbertAdmiral Halsey. Later that year exMoody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney had this to say on the groups formation Wings were always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow the Beatles success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position. However it was a choice between going on or finishing and I loved music too much to think of stopping. In September 1971, the McCartneys daughter Stella was born named in honour of Lindas grandmothers both of whom were named StellaFollowing the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough Wings first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said The main thing I didnt want was to come on stage faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking at me and saying Oh well he is not as good as he was. So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else so we went into Europe. During the sevenweek 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material the Little Richard cover Long Tall Sally was the only song that the Beatles had previously recorded. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 peopleIn March 1973, Wings achieved their first US numberone single My Love included on their second LP Red Rose Speedway a US number one and UK top five. McCartneys collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song Live and Let Die which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name. Nominated for an Academy Award the song reached number two in the US and number nine in the UK. It also earned Martin a Grammy for his orchestral arrangement. Music professor and author Vincent Benitez described the track as symphonic rock at its best.\nAfter the departure of McCullough and Seiwell in 1973, the McCartneys and Laine recorded Band on the Run. The album was the first of seven platinum Wings LPs. It was a US and UK number one the bands first to top the charts in both countries and the first ever to reach Billboard magazines charts on three separate occasions. One of the bestselling releases of the decade it remained on the UK charts for 124 weeks. Rolling Stone named it one of the Best Albums of the Year for 1973, and in 1975, Paul McCartney and Wings won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance for the song Band on the Run and Geoff Emerick won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording for the album. In 1974, Wings achieved a second US numberone single with the title track. The album also included the topten hits Jet and Helen Wheels and earned the 418th spot on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 1974, McCartney hired guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton to replace McCullough and Seiwell. Britton subsequently quit during recording sessions in 1975 and was replaced by Joe EnglishWings followed Band on the Run with the charttopping albums Venus and Mars 1975) and Wings at the Speed of Sound 1976). In 1975, they began the fourteenmonth Wings Over the World Tour which included stops in the UK Australia Europe and the US. The tour marked the first time McCartney performed Beatles songs live with Wings with five in the twohour set list Ive Just Seen a Face Yesterday Blackbird Lady Madonna and The Long and Winding Road. Following the second European leg of the tour and extensive rehearsals in London the group undertook an ambitious US arena tour that yielded the US numberone live triple LP Wings over AmericaIn September 1977, the McCartneys third child was born a son they named James. In November the Wings song Mull of Kintyre cowritten with Laine was quickly becoming one of the bestselling singles in UK chart history. The most successful single of McCartneys solo career it achieved double the sales of the previous record holder She Loves You and went on to sell 25 million copies and hold the UK sales record until the 1984 charity single Do They Know Its Christmas?\nLondon Town 1978) spawned a US numberone single With a Little Luck and continued Wings string of commercial successes making the top five in both the US and the UK. Critical reception was unfavourable and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album. Back to the Egg 1979) featured McCartneys assemblage of a rock supergroup dubbed Rockestra on two tracks. The band included Wings along with Pete Townshend David Gilmour Gary Brooker John Paul Jones John Bonham and others. Though certified platinum critics panned the album. Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs Got to Get You into My Life The Fool on the Hill and Let It Be.In 1980, McCartney released his second solo LP the selfproduced McCartney II which peaked at number one in the UK and number three in the US. As with his first album he composed and performed it alone. The album contained the song Coming Up the live version of which recorded in Glasgow Scotland in 1979 by Wings became the groups last numberone hit. By 1981, McCartney felt he had accomplished all he could creatively with Wings and decided he needed a change. The group discontinued in April 1981 after Laine quit following disagreements over royalties and salaries.\n\n1982\u20131990\nIn 1982, McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martinproduced numberone hit Ebony and Ivory included on McCartneys Tug of War LP and with Michael Jackson on The Girl Is Mine from Thriller. Ebony and Ivory was McCartneys record 28th single to hit number one on the Billboard 100. The following year he and Jackson worked on Say Say Say McCartneys most recent US number one as of 2014. McCartney earned his latest UK number one as of 2014 with the title track of his LP release that year Pipes of Peace.In 1984, McCartney starred in the musical Give My Regards to Broad Street a feature film he also wrote and produced and which included Starr in an acting role. It was disparaged by critics Variety described the film as characterless bloodless and pointless while Roger Ebert awarded it a single star writing you can safely skip the movie and proceed directly to the soundtrack. The album fared much better reaching number one in the UK and producing the US topten hit single No More Lonely Nights featuring David Gilmour on lead guitar. In 1985, Warner Brothers commissioned McCartney to write a song for the comedic feature film Spies Like Us. He composed and recorded the track in four days with Phil Ramone coproducing. McCartney participated in Live Aid performing Let it Be but technical difficulties rendered his vocals and piano barely audible for the first two verses punctuated by squeals of feedback. Equipment technicians resolved the problems and David Bowie Alison Moyet Pete Townshend and Bob Geldof joined McCartney on stage receiving an enthusiastic crowd reactionMcCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on Press to Play 1986) with Stewart cowriting more than half the songs on the LP. In 1988, McCartney released \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 initially available only in the Soviet Union which contained eighteen covers recorded over the course of two days. In 1989, he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of Ferry Cross the Mersey for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund. That same year he released Flowers in the Dirt a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins. McCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars Paul Wix Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums. In September 1989, they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour his first in over a decade. During the tour McCartney performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990, when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro Brazil. That year he released the triple album Tripping the Live Fantastic which contained selected performances from the tour.\n\n1991\u20131999\nMcCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991 when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis producing Liverpool Oratorio. The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa Sally Burgess Jerry Hadley and Willard White with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. The Guardian was especially critical describing the music as afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo and adding that the piece has little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole. The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the works faster tempos and added happily history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work. The New York Times was slightly more generous stating There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the musics innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions. Performed around the world after its London premiere the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart Music Week.\nIn 1991, McCartney performed a selection of acousticonly songs on MTV Unplugged and released a live album of the performance titled Unplugged The Official Bootleg.

A natural melodista creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony. McCartney likened his approach to the primitive cave artists who drew without training.\n\nEarly influences\nMcCartneys earliest musical influences include Elvis Presley Little Richard Buddy Holly Carl Perkins and Chuck Berry. When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the Sgt. Pepper cover McCartney replied Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didnt put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer he was Elvis the King. McCartney stated that for his bassline for I Saw Her Standing There he directly quoted Berrys Im Talking About You.McCartney called Little Richard an idol whose falsetto vocalisations inspired McCartneys own vocal technique. McCartney said he wrote Im Down as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation. In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Hollys catalogue and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Hollys birth McCartney inaugurated the annual Buddy Holly Week in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians songwriting competitions drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.\n\nBass guitar\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists in particular James Jamerson whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson as he commented because he went to very unusual places. Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke. McCartneys skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo and Colin Moulding of XTCMcCartney has consistently been ranked at or near the top of lists of the best bass players ever. He was voted the best rock bassist in Creems 1973 and 1974 Reader Poll Results and the third best rock bassist in its 1975 and 1977 Reader Poll Results. He was voted the third best bassist of all time in a 2011 Rolling Stone readers poll and in 2020, the same magazine ranked him the ninth greatest bassist of all time. In 2020,  Bass Player magazine ranked him the third best bass player of all time. He was voted the fifth greatest bassist of all time in a 2021 MusicRadar readers poll. Music critic J. D. Considine ranked McCartney the second best bass player.\n\nDuring McCartneys early years with the Beatles he primarily used a H\u00f6fner 500/1 bass although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers by 1967, he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s he used a Wal 5-String which he said made him play more thicksounding basslines in contrast to the much lighter H\u00f6fner which inspired him to play more sensitively something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the H\u00f6fner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing liveMacDonald identified Shes a Woman as the turning point when McCartneys bass playing began to evolve dramatically and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartneys playing exhibited significant progress particularly on The Word. Bacon and Morgan agreed calling McCartneys groove on the track a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument. MacDonald inferred the influence of James Browns Papas Got a Brand New Bag and Wilson Picketts In the Midnight Hour American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he delivered his most spontaneous basspart to date.Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song Rain as an astonishing piece of playing ... McCartney thinking in terms of both rhythm and lead bass ... choosing the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove. MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in exotic melismas in the bass part on Rain and described the playing as so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track. By contrast he recognised McCartneys bass part on the Harrisoncomposed Something as creative but overly busy and too fussily extemporised. McCartney identified Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing particularly on Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\n\nAcoustic guitar\nMcCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include Yesterday Michelle Blackbird I Will Mother Natures Son and Rocky Raccoon. McCartney singled out Blackbird as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way I got my own little sort of cheating way of fingerpicking ... Im actually sort of pulling two strings at a time ... I was trying to emulate those folk players. He employed a similar technique for Jenny Wren. He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings but also used a Martin D28.\n\nElectric guitar\nMcCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings including what MacDonald described as a fiercely angular slide guitar solo on Drive My Car which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this. McCartney bought the Casino in 1964, on the knowledge that the guitars hollow body would produce more feedback. He has retained that original guitar to the present day. He contributed what MacDonald described as a startling guitar solo on the Harrison composition Taxman and the shrieking guitar on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Helter Skelter. MacDonald also praised McCartneys coruscating pseudoIndian guitar solo on Good Morning Good Morning. McCartney also played lead guitar on Another Girl.During his years with Wings McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members though he played most of the lead guitar on Band on the Run. In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen Eric Clapton and David Gilmour stating but I still like Hendrix the best. He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work particularly during live performancesIn addition to these guitars McCartney is known to use and own a range of other electric guitars usually favouring the Fender Esquire and its subsequent incarnation the Fender Telecaster using the latter with a sunburst finish on Wings tours in the 1970s. He also owns a rare Ampeg Dan Armstrong Plexi guitar the only left handed one known to be in existence which appeared in the Wings video for Helen Wheels.\n\nVocals\nMcCartney is known for his belting power versatility and wide tenor vocal range spanning over four octaves. He was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone voted the 8th greatest singer ever by NME readers and number 10 by Music Radar readers in the list of the 30 greatest lead singers of all time. Over the years McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by Chris Cornell Billy Joel Steven Tyler Brad Delp and Axl RoseMcCartneys vocals have crossed several music genres throughout his career. On Call Me Back Again according to Benitez McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist while MacDonald called Im Down a rockandroll classic that illustrates McCartneys vocal and stylistic versatility. MacDonald described Helter Skelter as an early attempt at heavy metal and Hey Jude as a poprock hybrid pointing out McCartneys use of gospelstyle melismas in the song and his pseudosoul shrieking in the fadeout. Benitez identified Hope of Deliverance and Put It There as examples of McCartneys folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered When Im SixtyFour and Honey Pie attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the swinging beat of the Beatles twentyfour bar blues song Shes a Woman as the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date with McCartneys voice at the edge squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment. MacDonald described Ive Got a Feeling as a raunchy midtempo rocker with a robust and soulful vocal performance and Back in the USSR. as the last of the Beatles uptempo rockers McCartneys belting vocals among his best since Drive My Car recorded three years earlierMcCartney also teasingly tried out classical singing namely singing various renditions of Besame Mucho with the Beatles. He continued experimenting with various musical and vocal styles throughout his postBeatles career. Monkberry Moon Delight was described by Pitchforks Jayson Greene as an absolutely unhinged vocal take Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear adding that it could be a latterday Tom Waits performance.\n\nKeyboards\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs including Shes a Woman For No One A Day in the Life Hello Goodbye Lady Madonna Hey Jude Martha My Dear Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road. MacDonald considered the piano part in Lady Madonna as reminiscent of Fats Domino and Let It Be as having a gospel rhythm. MacDonald called McCartneys Mellotron intro on Strawberry Fields Forever an integral feature of the songs character. McCartney played a Moog synthesiser on the Beatles song Maxwells Silver Hammer and the Wings track Loup 1st Indian on the Moon. Ingham described the Wings songs With a Little Luck and London Town as being full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches.\n\nDrums\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles songs Back in the USSR. Dear Prudence Martha My Dear Wild Honey Pie and The Ballad of John and Yoko. He also played all the drum parts on his albums McCartney McCartney II and McCartney III as well as on Wings Band on the Run and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. His other drumming contributions include Paul Jones rendition of And the Sun Will Shine 1968) Steve Miller Bands 1969 tracks Celebration Song and My Dark Hour and Sunday Rain from the Foo Fighters 2017 album Concrete and Gold.\n\nTape loops\nIn the mid1960s when visiting artist friend John Dunbars flat in London McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at thengirlfriend Jane Ashers home. They included mixes of various songs musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him. Heavily influenced by American avantgarde musician John Cage McCartney made tape loops by recording voices guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as electronic symphonies. He reversed the tapes sped them up and slowed them down to create the desired effects some of which the Beatles later used on the songs Tomorrow Never Knows and The Fool on the Hill.\n\nPersonal life\nCreative outlets\nWhile at school during the 1950s McCartney thrived at art assignments often earning top accolades for his visual work. However his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades preventing him from earning admission to art college. During the 1960s he delved into the visual arts explored experimental cinema and regularly attended film theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London avantgarde scene was through artist John Dunbar who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser. At Frasers flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol Claes Oldenburg Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later purchased works by Magritte whose painting of an apple had inspired the Apple Records logo. McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Masons Yard London which Barry Miles had cofounded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also cofounded International Times an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartneys official biography Many Years from Now 1997).McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Koonings Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen Germany in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartneys art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartneys paintings opened featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol England. In October 2000, McCartneys art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool. McCartney said Ive been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So Im really excited about it. I didnt tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now Im out of the closet. McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for BoysWhen McCartney was a child his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him to increase their word power as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book he explains When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningfulwhich was promptly rejectedand I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since. His first childrens book was published by Faber  Faber in 2005, High in the Clouds An Urban Furry Tail a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years as an animated film.

Following the breakup of the Beatles McCartneys music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles partnership in 1975, McCartney resigned with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US Canada and Japan acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canadareportedly receiving the industrys most lucrative recording contract to date while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world.

In 2007, McCartney signed with Hear Music becoming the labels first artist. He returned to Capitol for 2018's Egypt Station.\nIn 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of LennonMcCartney. McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grades Associated Television ATV after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973.

Soon afterward ATV Musics parent company Associated Communications Corp was acquired in a takeover by businessman Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court who later sold ATV Music to Michael Jackson in 1985. McCartney has criticised Jacksons purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported 59,052,000 95 million establishing SonyATV Music Publishing in which he retained halfownership. Northern Songs was formally dissolved in 1995, and absorbed into the SonyATV catalogue.

Bob Dylan introduced them to cannabis in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting very high and giggling uncontrollably. His use of the drug soon became habitual and according to Miles McCartney wrote the lyrics another kind of mind in Got to Get You into My Life specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and for about a year in total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwardsInitially reluctant to try LSD McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second acid trip in March 1967 with Lennon after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly declaring It opened my eyes ... and made me a better more honest more tolerant member of society. McCartney made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he along with the other Beatles and Epstein added his name to a July advertisement in The Times which called for its legalisation the release of those imprisoned for possession and research into marijuanas medical uses. In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney 1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a 100 fine.\nAs a result of his drug convictions the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975 in Los Angeles Linda took the blame and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan customs officials found approximately 8 ounces 230 g of cannabis in his luggage. Years later McCartney said I dont know what possessed me to just stick this bloody great bag of grass in my suitcase. Thinking back on it it almost makes me shudder. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days they released and deported him without chargeIn 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him 200. Upon his return to England he stated that cannabis was less harmful than the legal substances alcohol tobacco and glue and that he had done no harm to anyone. In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of cannabis People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong. McCartney quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.\n\nVegetarianism and activism\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian. He and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage. They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb.

In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said Heres the deal my father was born in Everton my family are officially Evertonians so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish who had been to the gig and I thought You know what? I am just going to support them both because its all Liverpool.\n\nRelationships\nGirlfriends\nDot Rhone\nMcCartneys first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy Dot Rhone whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959. According to Spitz Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and makeup for her encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardots hairstyle and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled to disappointing effect. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles he wrote to Rhone regularly and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The couple had a twoandahalfyear relationship and were due to marry until Rhones miscarriage. According to Spitz McCartney now free of obligation ended the engagement.\n\nJane Asher\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963 when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartneys own home in St Johns Wood in March 1966. He wrote several songs while living with the Ashers including Yesterday And I Love Her You Wont See Me and Im Looking Through You the latter three having been inspired by their romance. They had a fiveyear relationship and planned to marry but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered that McCartney had become involved with Francie Schwartz an American screenwriter who moved to London at age 23, thinking she could sell a script to the Beatles. Schwartz met McCartney and he invited her to move into his London house where events ensued that possibly broke up his relationship with Asher.\n\nWives\nLinda Eastman\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio. At times she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular photographer with several rock groups including the Jimi Hendrix Experience the Grateful Dead the Doors and the Beatles whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast and I found it was Paul I liked. The pair first became properly acquainted on 15 May 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag ONails club during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers The night Linda and I met I spotted her across a crowded club and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!Linda said this about their meeting I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else that night ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up. The pair married in March 1969. About their relationship Paul said We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we arent our favourite thing really is to just hang to have fun. And Lindas very big on just following the moment. He added We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married and it was nearly called off ... its miraculous that we made it. But we did.After the breakup of the Beatles the two collaborated musically and formed Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul who explained she conquered those nerves got on with it and was really gutsy. Paul defended her musical ability I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard ... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things ... she did very well and made it look easier than it was ... The critics would say Shes not really playing or Look at hershes playing with one finger. But what they didnt know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic. He went on to say We thought we were in it for the fun ... it was just something we wanted to do so if we got it wrongbig deal. We didnt have to justify ourselves. Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda trying to get things together with a learner in the group didnt work as far as I was concerned.They had four childrenLindas daughter Heather legally adopted by Paul Mary Stella and Jamesand remained married until Lindas death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died Paul said I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt about wishing Id been perfect all the time ... a real bugger. But then I thought hang on a minute. Were just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.\n\nHeather Mills\nIn 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills a former model and antilandmine campaigner. In 2003, the couple had a child Beatrice Milly named in honour of Millss late mother and one of McCartneys aunts. They separated in April 2006 and divorced acrimoniously in May 2008. In 2004, he commented on media animosity toward his partners the British public didnt like me giving up on Jane Asher ... I married Linda a New York divorcee with a child and at the time they didnt like that.\n\nNancy Shevell\nMcCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Marylebone Town Hall London on 9 October 2011. The wedding was a modest event attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends. The couple had been together since November 2007. Shevell is vice president of a familyowned transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight. She is a former member of the board of the New York areas Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Shevell is about 18 years younger than McCartney. They had known each other for about 20 years prior to marrying having met because both had homes in the Hamptons.\n\nBeatles\nJohn Lennon\nThough McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon postBeatles they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion. In later years the two grew apart. McCartney often phoned Lennon but was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call Lennon told him Youre all pizza and fairytales! In an effort to avoid talking only about business they often spoke of cats babies or baking breadOn 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were watching an episode of Saturday Night Live at Lennons home in the Dakota when Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartneys last telephone call to Lennon days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy was friendly It is a consoling factor for me because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great and we didnt have any kind of blowup he said.\n\nReaction to Lennons murder\nOn 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night Lennons death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction he responded Its a drag. The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said What do you think about it? I said Its a draaag and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said Its a drag. It seemed a very flippant comment to make. He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder and his last conversation with Lennon\n\nI talked to Yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was John was really fond of you. The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down those granny glasses and say its only me. They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.\nIn 1983, McCartney said I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his mask and have a better relationship with him. He said that he went home that night watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennons death made the remaining exBeatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrisons tribute to Lennon All Those Years Ago which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released Here Today in 1982, a song Everett described as a haunting tribute to McCartneys friendship with Lennon.\n\nGeorge Harrison\nDiscussing his relationship with McCartney Harrison said Paul would always help along when youd done his ten songsthen when he got round to doing one of my songs he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish actually ... There were a lot of tracks though where I played bass ... because what Paul would doif hed written a song hed learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say sometimes he was very difficult Do this. Hed never give you the opportunity to come out with something.After Harrisons death in November 2001, McCartney said he was a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour. He went on to say We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times togetherthats what I am going to remember. Ill always love him hes my baby brother. On the first anniversary of his death McCartney played Harrisons Something on a ukulele at the Concert for George he would perform this rendition of the song on many subsequent solo tours. He also performed For You Blue and All Things Must Pass and played the piano on Eric Claptons rendition of While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\n\nRingo Starr\nDuring a recording session for The Beatles in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartneys critique of Starrs drum part for Back in the USSR. which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band. Starr later commented on working with McCartney Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined ... to get his own way ... thus musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time.\nMcCartney and Starr collaborated on several postBeatles projects starting in 1973 when McCartney contributed instrumentation and backing vocals for Six OClock a song McCartney wrote for Starrs album Ringo. McCartney played a kazoo solo on Youre Sixteen from the same album. Starr appeared as a fictional version of himself in McCartneys 1984 film Give My Regards to Broad Street and played drums on most tracks of the soundtrack album which includes rerecordings of several McCartneypenned Beatles songs. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on Beautiful Night from McCartneys 1997 album Flaming Pie. The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starrs Vertical Man which featured McCartneys backing vocals on three songs and instrumentation on oneIn 2009, the pair performed With a Little Help from My Friends at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation. They collaborated on Starrs album Y Not in 2010. McCartney played bass on Peace Dream and sang a duet with Starr on Walk with You. On 7 July 2010, Starr was performing at Radio City Music Hall in New York with his AllStarr Band in a concert celebrating his seventieth birthday. After the encores McCartney made a surprise appearance performing the Beatles song Birthday with Starrs band. On 26 January 2014, McCartney and Starr performed Queenie Eye from McCartneys new album New at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. McCartney inducted Starr into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, and played bass on his 2017 album Give More Love. On 16 December 2018, Starr and Ronnie Wood joined McCartney onstage to perform Get Back at his concert at Londons O2 Arena. Starr also made an appearance on the final day of McCartneys Freshen Up tour in July 2019, performing Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Reprise and Helter Skelter.\n\nLegacy\nAchievements\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999.

He is the lead guitarist with Roxy Music and was the lead guitarist with 801 and Quiet Sun. In 2006, Manzanera coproduced David Gilmours album On an Island and played in Gilmours band for tours in Europe and North America. He wrote and presented a series of 14 onehour radio programmes for station Planet Rock entitled The AZ of Great Guitarists.\n\nEarly life\nManzanera was born on 31 January 1951 in London England to a Colombian mother nee Manzanera and an English father who worked for British Overseas Airways Corporation and spent most of his childhood in different parts of the Americas including Hawaii Venezuela Colombia and Cuba. It was in Havana Cuba living under Batista that the young Manzanera aged six encountered his first guitar a Spanish guitar owned by his mother. His earliest musical accomplishments were Cuban folk songs inspired by the Cuban Revolution.\nIn Venezuela the eightyearold Manzanera started experimenting with the sounds of the electric guitar. During his teenage years he was absorbing the twin influences of 1960s rock and roll and Latin American rhythms of merengue cumbia and particularly the boleros of the Mexican Armando Manzanero.\nIn his late teens Manzanera  then a boarder at Dulwich College in south east London England where his brother was also a student  formed a series of school bands with his friends Bill MacCormick later a member of Matching Mole and Random Hold MacCormicks brother Ian better known as music writer Ian MacDonald and drummer Charles Hayward later of This Heat and Camberwell Now. Among the younger students at the school who saw the older boys performing in these various bands were Simon Ainley later in 801) David Ferguson and David Rhodes Ainley was briefly the lead vocalist for 801 in 1977, and all three were members of the late1970s progressive group Random Hold Rhodes subsequently became a longserving member of Peter Gabriels backing band.\nThe final incarnation of Manzaneras Dulwich College bands  a psychedelic outfit dubbed Pooh  the Ostrich Feathers  evolved into the progressive rock quartet Quiet Sun with the addition of keyboard player Dave Jarrett. They wrote a number of original songs and instrumental pieces none of which were recorded until years later and the band broke up when McCormick joined Matching Mole but Manzanera briefly revived the group in 1975 to record a full LP of their original music during the making of his first solo album Diamond Head later he included two other previously unrecorded Quiet Sun tracks on his 2008 album Firebird V11, which also featured Charles Hayward.\n\nMusic career\nRoxy Music 1971\u20131983)\nManzanera was determined to join a professional band and in October 1971 he was one of about twenty players who auditioned as lead guitarist for the recently formed art rock band Roxy Music. Manzanera displayed a wideranging interest in music. Influenced by his childhood sojourns in Latin America and his stints at boarding school he came to know several prominent musicians including Soft Machines Robert Wyatt and Pink Floyds David Gilmour who was a friend of his older brother EugeneManzanera was not initially hired as a guitarist for Roxy Music but instead was hired as a roadieguitar tech.  After David OList left the group in early 1972 before the group had made any commercially issued recordings Manzanera was invited to replace OList as Roxy Musics guitarist.  His bandmates at this time were Bryan Ferry Brian Eno Paul Thompson Andy Mackay and Graham Simpson. Roxy Musics rise was meteoric with the band being hailed as a major stylistic influence of the early 1970s. During the next 12 years until 1983 when the band members went on a long break Roxy Music released a series of internationally bestselling albums achieving ten UK Top Ten albums and touring extensively throughout the world. Although Ferry had sole writing credit on the first two LPs and his work dominated the groups output Manzanera was credited as cowriter with Ferry on the following Roxy Music songs\nAmazona Stranded 1973)\nOut of the Blue and Prairie Rose Country Life 1974)\nWhirlwind and Nightingale Siren 1975)\nManifesto Still Falls The Rain Trash and My Little Girl Manifesto 1979)\nTrash 2\" Trash single Bside 1979)\nOver You No Strange Delight and Running Wild Flesh  Blood 1980)\nLover Same Old Scene single Bside 1980)\nTake a Chance with Me Avalon 1982)Manzanera also received sole composer credit on the following Roxy Music song\n\nHula Kula Street Life single Bside 1973)In parallel with Roxy Music Manzanera has always pursued solo projects both recording his own albums and producing for others. His first major credit as producer was in 1975; after spotting the New Zealand group Split Enz who had supported Roxy Music on their 1974 Australian tour Manzanera produced the groups second LP Second Thoughts which was recorded in LondonManzanera played guitar on three tracks of the first Brian Eno album Here Come the Warm Jets as well as guitar and production assistance on Enos second solo album Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy.All his previous solo albums have been digitally remastered and rereleased with new artwork on his own label Expression Records.\n\nSolo work and collaborations 1975\u20132001)\nAs a writer producer and solo artist Phil Manzanera has worked with many of the luminaries of modern music such as Steve Winwood David Gilmour John Cale Godley  Creme Nico and John Wetton. He has cowritten material with many artists including Brian Eno Tim Finn Robert Wyatt and Gilmour.  Manzanera cowrote Pink Floyds single One Slip from their 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason album.\nManzaneras first solo album Diamond Head 1975) featured an allstar lineup of session contributors including most of the former and current members of Roxy Music except Bryan Ferry. Brian Eno cowrote and sang on two tracks Big Day and Miss Shapiro Paul Thompson Eddie Jobson and Andy Mackay all contributed and Roxy Musics occasional tour bassist John Wetton ex Family and then a member of King Crimson played bass and duetted on vocals with Doreen Chanter on Same Time Next Week. Robert Wyatt cowrote and sang in Spanish on Frontera and the members of Manzaneras preRoxy Music group Quiet Sun featured on the instrumental tracks. Concurrent with the recording of Diamond Head Manzanera reunited Quiet Sun who had not been able to make any professional recordings and used the studio time to quickly record a full LP of Quiet Sun material released by EG Records under the title Mainstream.\nReworked versions of two tracks from Mainstream featured on Manzaneras next major collaboration the critically acclaimed concert recording 801 Live which was recorded at a 1976 London show performed by the special occasion band 801. The group comprised Manzanera with Eno on vocals synth and treatments Quiet Sun bassist Bill MacCormick Curved Air keyboardist Francis Monkman 19-yearold drumming prodigy Simon Phillips and slide guitarist Lloyd Watson who had previously performed as a solo support act for Roxy Music. The LP featured an eclectic mix of Manzanera Quiet Sun and Eno originals alongside distinctive cover versions of two wellknown tracks The Beatles Tomorrow Never Knows and The Kinks You Really Got Me. The album also broke new ground in live concert recording being one of the first live LPs to use the direct injection DI method of recording in which the signals from the various electric instruments were fed directly into the recording console enabling a dramatic improvement in fidelity over the earlier method of placing microphones near the various instrument amplifiers.\nThe success of the live album led to the creation of a more permanent incarnation of 801, without Lloyd Watson. Manzaneras old schoolmate Simon Ainley who was later a member of Random Hold with Bill McCormick took over from Eno as lead vocalist who only provided treatments and textures. Francis Monkman Bill and Ian McCormick and Simon Phillips became part of an allstar session group that also included Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner of Split Enz who had by then relocated to the UK former 10cc members Kevin Godley and Lol Creme saxophonist Mel Collins Roxy Musics Eddie Jobson and drummer Dave Mattacks. The new 801 recorded the studio album Listen Now was released in November 1976, although according to Ainley the initial recordings had begun in December 1975, well before the original concert lineup of 801 was put together. The studio LP was not a commercial success and the group disbanded after a short UK tour. A live performance at Manchester University in Nov. 1977, with Ainley on vocals and guitar and appearances by special guests Andy Mackay Kevin Godley and Lol Creme was recorded on 24-track tape but the recording remained unreleased until 1997Manzaneras second solo album KScope 1978) was originally intended to be the second 801 studio album and indeed it featured many of the same personnel from Listen Now including Ainley Bill and Ian McCormick John Wetton Simon Phillips Mel Collins Tim and Neil Finn Eddie Rayner Godley and Creme and keyboard player Dave Skinner. According to Ainley he was slated to perform the lead vocal tracks and he contributed to the composition of the track Slow Motion TV but by his own account he had a severe cold the day he began recording his vocals and could not hit the notes as a result Manzanera replaced him with Tim Finn and Ainley contributed only rhythm guitar to a couple of tracks. The LP was eventually released under Manzaneras name but shortly after it was released Roxy Music reformed and Manzaneras solo projects were put on hold until the group disbanded again in 1982His third solo album Primitive Guitars 1982) marked his tenth anniversary as a professional musician. It was intended as a retrospective of his musical influences and stylistic growth interpreted through a series of solo pieces that represent various stages in his life  childhood in South America adolescence in London his work in Roxy Music and 801, and other projects. Manzanera plays all the instruments backed only by a drum machine except for one track that features John Wetton on bass. In between tracks Manzanera inserted snatches of dialogue recorded at various rehearsalsIn the 1990s Manzanera performed in concerts all over the world including at Guitar Legends the fiveday guitar festival in Seville where he was musical director for the event as well as playing with Bob Dylan Keith Richards Jack Bruce Vicente Amigo Dave Edmunds Joe Satriani Steve Cropper Aterciopelados Robert Cray and Richard Thompson. He has also played in Mexico Argentina Colombia Cuba Spain France Italy and the UK including a tendate European tour with the Cuban band Grupo Moncada.

Manzanera produced in 1993 the highly acclaimed album Severino from the Brazilian rock band Os Paralamas do Sucesso which included a participation by Brian May.\n\nRoxy Music reunion and later work 2001\u2013present\nThe Roxy Music long break came to an end in 2001 with a critically and commercially successful 52-date world tour. In the summer of 2003 Roxy Music played 10 dates in the US followed by 13 European gigs in 2004, including performing at Live 8 in Berlin. The ongoing reunion went on hiatus after their last performance of 2011, and they would not give another commercial performance for over a decade.\nManzanera had a stateoftheart studio Gallery Studios in West London now Songphonic Records. The first recording was Robert Wyatts album Shleep 1996-1997) and the client list included Brian Eno David Gilmour Annie Lennox Kevin Ayers and Chrissie Hynde. Wyatts critically acclaimed album Comicopera was recorded at Gallery in 2007.\nManzanera began singing on his own albums with Vozero in 2001, followed by 6pm in 2004 and 50 Minutes Later in 2005. He appeared at The Strat Pack celebration concert at Wembley Arena in 2005, alongside other musicians such as Hank Marvin Ronnie Wood and David Gilmour. He also worked as session musician on Eno and David Byrnes 2008 album Everything That Happens Will Happen Today.\nBetween 2003 and 2008, he collaborated with Colombian artistsculptor Lucho Brieva in the group Corroncho. The project sprang from a Spanish version of the track Complicada written by Brievas wife Chrissie Hynde. The resulting album comprises a set of songs about two corroncho characters corroncho being the pejorative name given by people from Bogot\u00e1 to fellow Colombians from the Caribbean Coast particularly Barranquilla. The album includes the musical styles of salsa cumbia pop music ballads and chillout and has guest appearancesFirebird V11 2008) was another allinstrumental album recorded with a 3-piece backing group that included his old Quiet Sun bandmate Charles Hayward on drums Polish jazz pianist Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer and bassist Yaron Stavi from the Gilad Atzmon band. It includes two original Quiet Sun tracks written in 1970, which had never been previously recorded. As the title indicates the album is a tribute to and feature for Manzaneras signature guitar the redandblack Gibson Firebird V11 guitar which he has played throughout his career   he can be seen holding the guitar in the centrefold photograph on Roxy Musics second album For Your Pleasure in 1972, and a photographically distorted image of it was used on the cover of Primitive Guitars.\nIn 2011, JayZ and Kanye West used a sample of a guitar riff from Manzaneras 1978 solo album KScope in a track on their Watch the Throne album. Manzanera was allocated onethird of resulting royalties and publishing revenue for the song. The album went Gold in the UK and Platinum in the US and the song was used in the film The Great Gatsby and in tv commercials. Manzanera commented in 2024 that he had earned more from a brief sequence of maybe twenty notes than he had in his 50 years with Roxy MusicIn 2015, he directed the final concert of the Notte della Taranta Festival in Salento ItalyIn March 2024, Manzanera published Revolucion to Roxy a memoir of his life and his time with Roxy Music.\n\nOther efforts\nManzanera coproduced David Gilmours album On an Island. Manzanera also played rhythm guitar on Gilmours world tour to support the album in 2006 and appears in Gilmours concert films Remember That Night and Live in Gda\u0144sk.\nManzanera appears briefly playing a guitar solo in Red Dwarf series 6 episode Psirens. Only his hands appeared playing the guitar and his credit on the IMDb lists his role as Hands of Psiren Lister. On screen he is credited as the hands of Phil Manzanera.\nHe wrote and presented a series of 14 onehour radio programmes for station Planet Rock entitled The AZ of Great Guitarists.\n\nGuitars and sound\nManzanera has played a variety of instruments throughout his career but he is best known for his signature guitar a 1964 Cardinal Red Gibson Firebird VII with goldplated pickups and tuners. This guitar became widely known to fans after Manzanera posed with it during the photo session that produced the inner gatefold photo for Roxy Musics second album For Your Pleasure in 1972, and he has used it regularly throughout his career. Manzanera also frequently uses two custommade Gibson Les Paul guitars one of which picture above features a mother of pearl inlay in the shape of an iguana. On tour and in the studio Manzanera also regularly plays Fender Stratocasters a Fender Telecaster and Blade guitars. On the evidence of the cover photographs for the 801 Live album he also played a Yamaha SG2000 guitar as used by Carlos Santana during the 801 period.\nBeginning in the early days of Roxy Music Manzaneras guitar sound was often heavily treated using various electronic devices and techniques including processing the output of his guitar through Enos synthesizers both in the studio and on stage. This allowed him to create a wide range of sounds and textures many of which are not immediately identifiable as having been produced by an electric guitar. On his solo album Primitive Guitars all the sounds on the album except the drum machine and the bass played by John Wetton on one track were produced by Manzaneras guitars.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1977, Manzanera purchased St. Anns Court in Chertsey consisting of a coach house which Manzanera converted into a recording studio and a main house designed in 1936 by the architect Sir Raymond McGrath. The gardens were created by Christopher Tunnard.\nThe recording studio was used to record Manzaneras solo albums and Roxy Musics Flesh  Blood and Avalon.

I wanted to be somebody.Madonnas father put her in classical piano lessons but she later convinced him to allow her to take ballet lessons.

Her seventh studio album Ray of Light 1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. Thats not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singersongwriter really. And William Orbit provided her with that.The album garnered critical acclaim with Slant Magazine calling it one of the great pop masterpieces of the 90s Ray of Light was honored with four Grammy Awardsincluding Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recordingand was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Rolling Stone listed it among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Commercially the album peaked at numberone in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide.

It featured elements from the electronicainspired Ray of Light era and like its predecessor received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef Madonna commented I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows aboutthe people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color technique style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that its easily as selfaware and earnest as Ray of Light. The album took the numberone position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the US Music debuted at the top and became her first numberone album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles the Hot 100 numberone Music Dont Tell Me and What It Feels Like for a Girl.

In May 2002 she appeared in London in the West End play Up for Grabs at the Wyndhams Theatre billed as Madonna Ritchie to universally bad reviews and was described as the evenings biggest disappointment by one. That October she released Die Another Day the title song of the James Bond film Die Another Day in which she also had a cameo role described by Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian as incredibly wooden.

The same year Madonna released her ninth studio album American Life which was based on her observations of American society. She explained that the record was like a trip down memory lane looking back at everything Ive accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me. Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent while also condemning it as a lazy halfarsed effort to sound and take her seriously. The original music video of its title track caused controversy due to its violence and antiwar imagery and was withdrawn after the 2003 invasion of Iraq started. Madonna voluntarily censored herself for the first time in her career due to the political climate of the country saying that there was a lynch mob mentality that was going on that wasnt pretty and I have children to protect.

So began my illustrious career as an artist refusing to compromise my artistic integrity ... artists are here to disturb the peace.The Celebration Tour began on October 14, 2023 at The O2 Arena in London. It was greeted with critical acclaim.\n\nArtistry\nInfluences\nMadonna has called Nancy Sinatra one of her idols. She said Sinatras These Boots Are Made for Walkin made a major impression on her. As a young woman she attempted to broaden her taste in literature art and music and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque and loved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin because she liked their feminine quality. Madonnas major influences include Debbie Harry Chrissie Hynde Patti Smith Karen Carpenter the Supremes Joni Mitchell Aretha Franklin and Led Zeppelin as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. She also grew up listening to David Bowie whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended.\nDuring her childhood Madonna was inspired by actors later saying I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny and they were silly and sweet and they were girls and  they were feminine and sexy. I just saw myself in them my funniness and my need to boss people around and at the same time be taken care of. My girlishness. My knowingness and my innocence. Both. Her Material Girl music video recreated Monroes look in the song Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes 1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s particularly those of Lombard in preparation for the film Whos That Girl. The video for Express Yourself 1989) was inspired by Fritz Langs silent film Metropolis 1927). The video for Vogue recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs in particular those by Horst P. Horst and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her including Bette Davis described by Madonna as an idolInfluences also came to her from the art world such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The music video of the song Bedtime Story featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo. Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempickas Art Deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours. Her video for Hollywood 2003) was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin Bourdins son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorized use of his fathers work. Pop artist Andy Warhols use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper.Madonnas Catholic background has been reflected throughout her career from her fashion use of rosary to her musical outputs including on Like a Prayer 1989). Her album MDNA 2012) has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through everyday life. In a 2016 interview she commented I always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism. It kind of shows up in all of my work as you may have noticed.  Her study of the Kabbalah was also observed in Madonnas music especially albums like Ray of Light and Music. Speaking of religion in a 2019 interview with Harry Smith of Today Madonna stated The God that I believe in created the world ... HeHerThey sic isnt a God to fear its a God to give thanks to. In an appearance on Andrew Dentons Interview she added The idea that in any church you go you see a man on a cross and everyone genuflects and prays to him ... in a way its paganismidolatry because people are worshipping a thing.\n\nMusical style and composition\nMadonnas music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis 2005) commented that Madonnas musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade The Eighties deemed Madonna an artist who pushed the boundaries of what a female singer could do both visually and lyrically. Professor Santiago FouzHern\u00e1ndez asserted While not gifted with an especially powerful or wideranging voice Madonna has worked to expand her artistic palette to encompass diverse musical textual and visual styles and various vocal guises all with the intention of presenting herself as a mature musician.Madonna has remained in charge in every aspect of her career including as a writer and producer in most of her own music. Her desire for control had already been seen during the making of her debut album where she fought Reggie Lucas over his production output. However it was not until her third album that Warner allowed Madonna to produce her own album. Stan Hawkins author of Settling the Pop Score explained it is as musician and producer that Madonna is one of the few female artists to have broken into the male domain of the recording studio. Undoubtedly Madonna is fully aware that women have been excluded from the musical workplace on most levels and has set out to change this. Producer Stuart Price stated You dont produce Madonna you collaborate with her.. She has her vision and knows how to get it. Despite being labeled a control freak Madonna has said that she valued input from her collaborators. She further explained\n\nI like to have control over most of the things in my career but Im not a tyrant. I dont have to have it on my album that its written arranged produced directed and stars Madonna. To me to have total control means you can lose objectivity. What I like is to be surrounded by really talented intelligent people that you can trust. And ask them for their advice and get their input.\n\nMadonnas early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. She subsequently became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album including Lucky Star which she composed on synthesizer. As a songwriter Madonna has registered more than 300 tracks to ASCAP including 18 songs written entirely by herself. Rolling Stone has named her an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics. Despite having worked with producers across many genres the magazine noted that Madonnas compositions have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Patrick Leonard who cowrote many of her hit songs called Madonna a helluva songwriter explaining Her sensibility about melodic linefrom the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each otheris very deep. Many times shes singing notes that no one wouldve thought of but her. Barry Walters from Spin credited her songwriting as the reason of her musical consistency. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Madonna at number 56 on the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time list.\n\nMadonnas discography is generally categorized as pop electronica and dance. Nevertheless Madonnas first foray into the music industry was dabbling in rock music with Breakfast Club and Emmy. As the frontwoman of Emmy Madonna recorded about 12\u201314 songs that resemble the punk rock of that period. Madonna soon abandoned playing rock songs by the time she signed to Gotham Records which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk direction. According to Erlewine Madonna began her career as a disco diva in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop and Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. Arie Kaplan in the book American Pop Hit Makers Superstars and Dance Revolutionaries referred to Madonna as a pioneer of dancepop. According to FouzHern\u00e1ndez Madonnas frequent use of dance idioms and subsequent association with gay or sexually liberated audiences is seen as somehow inferior to real rock and roll. But Madonnas music refuses to be defined by narrow boundaries of gender sexuality or anything else.The cold and emotional ballad Live to Tell as well as its parent album True Blue 1986) is noted as Madonnas first musical reinvention. PopMatters writer Peter Piatkowski described it as a very deliberate effort to present Madonna as a mature and serious artist. She continued producing ballads in between her upbeat material although albums such as Madonna 1983) and Confessions on a Dance Floor 2005) consist of entirely dance tracks. With Ray of Light 1998) critics acknowledged Madonna for bringing electronica from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene. Her other sonically drastic ventures include the 1930s bigband jazz on Im Breathless 1990) lush RB on Bedtime Stories 1994) operatic show tunes on Evita 1996) guitardriven folk music on American Life 2003) as well as multilingual world music on Madame X 2019).\n\nVoice and instruments\nPossessing a mezzosoprano vocal range Madonna has always been selfconscious about her voice. Mark Bego author of Madonna Blonde Ambition called her the perfect vocalist for lighterthanair songs despite not being a heavyweight talent. According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC Madonnas vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs straight but Madonna employs subtext irony aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did. Madonna used a bright girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became pass\u00e9 in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled her as Minnie Mouse on helium. During the filming of Evita 1996) Madonna had to take vocal lessons which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasnt using. Before I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.Besides singing Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. Piano was the first instrument taught to her as a child. In the late 1970s she learned to play drum and guitar from her thenboyfriend Dan Gilroy before joining the Breakfast Club lineup as the drummer. She later played guitar with the band Emmy as well as on her own demo recordings. After her career breakthrough Madonna was absent performing with guitar for years but she is credited for playing cowbell on Madonna 1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer 1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart but she eventually left the project before filming began. Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music 2000) and recruited guitarist Monte Pittman to help improve her skill. Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tour as well as her studio albums. She received a nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award at the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards.\n\nMusic videos and performances\nIn The Madonna Companion biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work more than any other recent pop artist. According to them many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots 1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is the video and the reigning queen of video is Madonna. He further asserted that the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonnas excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory. The media and public reaction towards her mostdiscussed songs such as Papa Dont Preach Like a Prayer or Justify My Love had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that artistically Madonnas songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos. In 2003, MTV named her The Greatest Music Video Star Ever and said that Madonnas innovation creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award. In 2020, Billboard ranked her atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time.\n\nMadonnas initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamour. She was able to transmit her avantgarde Downtown Manhattan fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era. Author Douglas Kellner noted such multiculturalism and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences. Madonnas Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time in the form of boleros and layered skirts accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of La Isla Bonita. Academics noted that with her videos Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for Like a Prayer. The video included scenes of an AfricanAmerican church choir Madonna being attracted to a black saint statue and singing in front of burning crossesMadonnas acting performances in films have frequently received poor reviews from film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in Time that Madonna seems wooden and unnatural as an actress and its tough to watch because shes clearly trying her damnedest. According to biographer Andrew Morton Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism but privately she is deeply hurt. After the critically panned boxoffice bomb Swept Away 2002) Madonna vowed never to act again in a film. While reviewing her career retrospective titled Body of Work 2016) at New Yorks Metrograph hall The Guardians Nigel M. Smith wrote that Madonnas film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her and she otherwise could steal a scene for all the right reasons.Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her bigscreen performances are panned her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally the fact that images from Madonnas videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the original videos realism. She believed that her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized. Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia latest technology and sound systems Madonnas concerts and live performances are extravagant show pieces and walking art shows.Chris Nelson from The New York Times commented that artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precisiontimed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing. Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lipsyncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour she has subsequently reorganized her performances by staying mostly still during her toughest singing parts and leaves the dance routines to her backup troupe ... rather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time. To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of handsfree radiofrequency headset microphones with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage the microphone design came to be known as the Madonna mic.\n\nLegacy\nMadonna has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists historians and other scholars contributing to the rise of Madonna studies a subfield of American cultural studies. According to Rodrigo Fres\u00e1n saying that Madonna is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that CocaCola is just a soda. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA. Rolling Stone Spain wrote She became the first master of viral pop in history years before the internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere in the almighty music television channels radio formulas magazine covers and even in bookstores. A pop dialectic never seen since the Beatless reign which allowed her to keep on the edge of trend and commerciality. William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that Madonna has changed the worlds social history has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to. Professor Diane Pecknold noted that nearly any poll of the biggest greatest or best in popular culture includes Madonnas name. In 2012, VH1 ranked Madonna as the greatest woman in music.\nSpin writer Bianca Gracie stated that the Queen of Pop isnt enough to describe Madonnashe is Pop. She formulated the blueprint of what a pop star should be. According to Sclafani Its worth noting that before Madonna most music megastars were guy rockers after her almost all would be female singers ... When the Beatles hit America they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it backwith an emphasis on the female. Howard Kramer curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame asserted that Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers. Andy Bennett and Steve Waksman authors of The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music 2014) noted that almost all female pop stars of recent yearsBritney Spears Beyonc\u00e9 Rihanna Katy Perry Lady Gaga and othersacknowledge the important influence of Madonna on their own careers. Madonna has also influenced male artists inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musiciansMadonnas use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. The Times wrote that she had started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex nudity style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice. Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self of sexuality and of ones social relations. In Doing Gender in Media Art and Culture 2009) the authors noted that Madonna as a female celebrity performer and pop icon can unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys Madonna represents womans occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex as powerful and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corv\u00e9e allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to her as an almost sacred feminist icon.Writing for The Guardian Matt Cain stated that Madonna has broken down social barriers and brought marginalized groups to the forefront by frequently featuring LGBT Latino and black culture in her works. An author said that by making culture generally available Madonna becomes the culture of all social classes. Canadian professor Karlene Faith gave her point of view saying that Madonnas peculiarity is that she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains and she has been a cult figure within selfpropelling subcultures just as she became a major. GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis stated that Madonna always has and always will be the LGBTQ communitys greatest ally while The Advocate dubbed her as the greatest gay icon.Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry and generating over 12 billion in sales within the first decade of her career. According to Gini Gorlinski in the book The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time 2010) Madonnas levels of power and control were unprecedented for a woman in the entertainment industry. London Business School academics called her a dynamic entrepreneur worth copying they identified her vision of success her understanding of the music industry her ability to recognize her own performance limits and thus bring in help her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that Madonna is opportunistic manipulative and ruthlesssomebody who wont stop until she gets what she wantsand thats something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her.\n\nAwards and achievements\nMadonnas net worth is estimated between US590 million to 800 million. Forbes has named her the annual topearning female musician 11 times across the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s. She has sold over 300 million records worldwide. The Guinness World Records acknowledged her as the bestselling female music artist of all time. According to the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA she is the bestselling female rock artist of the 20th century and the third highestcertified female albums artist in the United States with 655 million certified album units. She is tied with Barbra Streisand for the most RIAA multiplatinum albums by a female artistMadonna had generated over US15 billion from ticket sales of her concert tours throughout her career becoming the first woman to accumulate US1 billion in concert revenue. According to Pollstar she is the 3rd highestgrossing female touring artist of all time behind Taylor Swift and Beyonce. Madonna also remains the only woman in history to have two solo concerts with 100,000 sold tickets her Whos That Girl World Tours concert in Parc de Sceaux Paris drew over 130,000 audience while her Girlie Shows concert in Maracan\u00e3 Stadium Rio de Janeiro drew over 120,000 audience. She has also won seven Grammy Awards and twenty MTV Video Music Awards including the 1986 Video Vanguard Award for which she became the first female recipientAccording to Billboard Madonna is the most successful solo artist in the Hot 100 chart history second overall behind the Beatles and the most successful dance club artist of all time. With a total of 50 Dance Club Songs charttoppers Madonna became the artist with the most number ones on any singular Billboard chart pulling ahead of George Strait with 44 numberone songs on the Hot Country Songs chart. She has also scored 38 topten singles on the Hot 100; she held the record among all artists for nearly two decades between 2002 and 2020) before being overtaken by Drake and by Taylor Swift in 2022 among females. Internationally Madonna holds the record for the most numberone singles by a female artist in Australia 11) Canada 24) Italy 23) Finland 7) Spain 21) and the United Kingdom 13).

Knopfler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Dire Straits in 2018.\n\nBiography\n1949\u20131976: Early life\nMark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in Glasgow Scotland to an English mother Louisa Mary n\u00e9e Laidler and a Hungarian Jewish father Erwin Knopfler. His mother was a teacher and his father was an architect and a chess player who left his native Hungary in 1939 to flee the Nazis. Knopfler later described his father as a Marxist agnosticThe Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area where Marks younger brother David was born on 27 December 1952. Marks older sister Ruth was born in Newcastle where Marks parents were married in 1947. The family moved to Knopflers mothers hometown of Blyth near Newcastle in North East England when he was seven years old. Mark had attended Bearsden Primary School in Scotland for two years both brothers attended Gosforth Grammar School in Newcastle.\nOriginally inspired by his uncle Kingsleys harmonica and boogiewoogie piano playing Mark soon became familiar with many different styles of music. Although he hounded his father for an expensive Fiesta Red Fender Stratocaster electric guitar just like Hank Marvins he eventually bought a twinpickup H\u00f6fner Super Solid for 50 equivalent to 1,225 in 2021).In 1963, when he was 13, he took a Saturday job at the Newcastle Evening Chronicle newspaper earning six shillings and sixpence. Here he met the ageing poet Basil Bunting who was a copy editor. The two had little to say to each other but in 2015, Knopfler wrote a track in tribute to himAt this time Knopfler got around the country largely by hitchhiking and also hitched through Europe a number of timesDuring the 1960s he formed and joined several bands and listened to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins Scotty Moore BB King Django Reinhardt Hank Marvin and James Burton. At the age of 16, he made a local television appearance as part of a harmony duo with his classmate Sue HercombeIn 1968, after studying journalism for a year at Harlow College Knopfler was hired as a junior reporter in Leeds for the Yorkshire Evening Post. During this time he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer country blues enthusiast and parttime performer Steve Phillips one year his senior from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles. The two formed a duo called The Duolian String Pickers which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues. Two years later Knopfler decided to further his education and later graduated with a degree in English at the University of LeedsIn April 1970, while living in Leeds he recorded a demo disc of an original song he had written Summers Coming My Way. The recording included Knopfler guitar and vocals Steve Phillips second guitar Dave Johnson bass and Paul Granger percussion. Johnson Granger and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits The Notting Hillbillies.\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in High Wycombe called Brewers Droop appearing on the album The Booze Brothers. One night while spending time with friends the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extralight strings to make it usable. Even so he found it impossible to play unless he fingerpicked it leading to the development of his signature playing style. He said in a later interview That was where I found my voice on guitar. After a brief stint with Brewers Droop Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at Loughton College in Essex  a position he held for three years. Throughout this time he continued performing with local pub bands including the Caf\u00e9 RacersBy the mid1970s Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group the Caf\u00e9 Racers. His brother David moved to London where he shared a flat with John Illsley a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in Buckhurst Hill and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together and soon Mark invited John to join the Caf\u00e9 Racers.\n\n1977\u20131995: Dire Straits\nDire Straits first demos were recorded in three sessions in 1977, with David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist John Illsley as bass guitarist and Pick Withers as drummer. On 27 July 1977, they recorded the demo tapes of five songs Wild West End Sultans of Swing Down to the Waterline Sacred Loving a David Knopfler song and Water of Love. They later recorded Southbound Again In the Gallery and Six Blade Knife for BBC Radio Londonand finally on 9 November made demo tapes of Setting Me Up Eastbound Train and Real Girl. Many of these songs reflect Knopflers experiences in Newcastle Leeds and London and were featured on their first album the eponymous Dire Straits which was released in the following year Down to the Waterline recalled images of life in Newcastle In The Gallery is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips father of Steve Phillips and Lions Wild West End and Eastbound Train were all drawn from Knopflers early days in the capitalOn its initial release in October 1978, the album Dire Straits received little fanfare in the UK but when Sultans of Swing was released as a single it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off  first across Europe and then in the United States and Canada and finally the UK. The groups second album Communiqu\u00e9 produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett followed in June 1979.\nTheir third album Making Movies released in October 1980, moved towards more complex arrangements and production which continued for the remainder of the groups career. The album included many of Mark Knopflers most personal compositions most notably Romeo and Juliet and Tunnel of Love with its intro The Carousel Waltz by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II which also featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film An Officer and a Gentleman. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits from 1980 onwards with Mark Knopfler and John Illsley the only members to remain throughout the groups 18 year existence. In 1980 whilst the recording sessions for Making Movies were taking place tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career. The remaining trio continued the album with Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteens E Street Band guesting on keyboards and session guitarist Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar although he was uncredited on the album. After the recording sessions were completed keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as fulltime members for the On Location tour of Europe North America and OceaniaIn September 1982, the groups fourth studio album Love Over Gold was released. This featured the tracks Private Investigations Telegraph Road Industrial Disease It Never Rains and the title track of the album Love Over Gold. Shortly after the albums release Pick Withers left the band.\nIn early 1983, with Love Over Gold still in the albums charts the band released a foursong EP titled ExtendedancEPlay. Featuring the hit single Twisting by the Pool this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams formerly of Rockpile and Man. An eight month long Love over Gold Tour followed which finished with two soldout concerts at Londons Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. In March 1984 the double album Alchemy Live was released which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in VHS video and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart and was reissued in DVD and Bluray format in 2010.\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams played on Phil Everlys and Cliff Richards song She Means Nothing To Me which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1983, taken from the album Phil Everly. Knopfler had also expressed his interest writing film music and after producer David Puttnam responded he wrote and produced the music score to the film Local Hero. The album was released in April 1983 and received a BAFTA award nomination for Best Score for a Film the following year. Alan Clark also contributed and other Dire Straits members Illsley Lindes and Williams played on one track Freeway Flyer and Gerry Rafferty contributed lead vocals on The Way It Always Starts. The closing track on the album and on the credits in the film is the instrumental Going Home Theme of the Local Hero which was released as a single and became a popular live staple for Dire Straits entering the bands repertoire from 1983 onwards.Local Hero was followed in 1984 by Knopflers music scores for the films Cal soundtrack and Comfort and Joy both of which also featured Terry Williams as well as keyboardist Guy Fletcher. Also during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylans Infidels album as well as Knife by Aztec Camera. He also wrote the song Private Dancer for Tina Turners comeback album of the same name to which other Dire Straits members John Illsley Alan Clark Hal Lindes and Terry Williams contributed. Knopfler also contributed lead guitar to Bryan Ferrys album Boys and Girls released in June 1985.\n\nDire Straits biggest studio album by far was their fifth Brothers in Arms. Recording of the album started at the end of 1984 at George Martins Air Studios in Montserrat with Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman producing. There were further personnel changes. Guy Fletcher joined the band as a full time member so the group now had two keyboardists while second guitarist Hal Lindes left the band early on during the recording sessions and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni a New Yorkbased guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler although Sonnis contribution to the album was minimal. The then permanent drummer Terry Williams was released from the recording sessions after the first month and temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim who rerecorded the albums drum parts within three days before leaving for other commitments. Williams would be back in the band as a full time member for the music videos and the 1985\u20131986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followedReleased in May 1985, Brothers in Arms became an international blockbuster that has now sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and is the fourth best selling album in UK chart history. Brothers in Arms spawned several chart singles including the US  1 hit Money for Nothing which was the first video played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format as it was also one of the first DDD CDs ever released Other successful singles were So Far Away Walk of Life and the albums title track. The band embarked on a 1985\u20131986 Brothers in Arms world tour of over 230 shows which was immensely successful.\nAfter the Brothers in Arms world tour Dire Straits ceased to work together for some time Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble Ferry Aid on Let It Be in the wake of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The song reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in March 1987. Knopfler wrote the music score for the film The Princess Bride released at the end of 1987.\nMark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit featured on the French and Saunders Show titled The Easy Guitar Book Sketch with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians David Gilmour Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead Mark King from Level 42, and Gary Moore. Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmours guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skitDire Straits regrouped for 11 June 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium in which they were the headline act and were accompanied by Elton John and Eric Clapton who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. Jack Sonni and Terry Williams both officially left the band shortly afterwards. In September 1988 Mark Knopfler announced the official dissolution of Dire Straits saying that he needed a rest. In October 1988, a compilation album Money for Nothing was released and reached number one in the United KingdomIn 1989, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum. It leaned heavily towards American roots music  folk blues and country music. The band members included keyboardist Guy Fletcher with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. For both the album and the tour Paul Franklin was added to the lineup on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album Missing..Presumed Having a Good Time was released in 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with Chet Atkins Neck and Neck which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this lowkey tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.\n\nIn 1990, Knopfler John Illsley and Alan Clark performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth joined by Eric Clapton Ray Cooper and guitarist Phil Palmer who was at that time part of Eric Claptons touring band and in January the following year Knopfler John Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler Illsley Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by sidemen Phil Palmer pedal steel guitarist Paul Franklin percussionist Danny Cummings and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro.\nThe followup to Brothers in Arms was finally released in September 1991. On Every Street was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor and met with a mixed critical reaction with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a sixyear break. Nonetheless the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer Chris Whitten joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling world tour featuring 300 shows in front of some 71 million ticketbuying fans. This was to be Dire Straits final world tour it was not as well received as the previous Brothers in Arms tour and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager Ed Bicknell is quoted as saying The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of it had passed. John Illsley agreed saying Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody emotionally and physically. We were changed by it. This drove the band into the ground and ultimately led to the groups final dissolution in 1995.\nFollowing the tour Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released both live albums. On the Night released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits final world tour. In 1995, following the release of Live at the BBC a contractual release to Vertigo Records Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist. Knopfler later recalled that I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. Its selfprotection a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing. Knopfler would spend two years recovering from the experience which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.\nSince the breakup of Dire Straits Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopflers solo material to date while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently playing on three of Knopflers solo album releases All the Roadrunning with Emmylou Harris Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky. In October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform. Illsley said that a reunion would be entirely up to Mark however he also observed that Knopfler was enjoying his success as a solo artist. When asked about a possible reunion Knopfler responded Oh I dont know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again and that the global fame Dire Straits achieved in the 1980s just got too big.In 2018, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Knopfler did not attend the induction ceremony however remaining members John Illsley Guy Fletcher and Alan Clark were in attendance to accept the award on behalf of the band.\nIn November 2021 John Illsley published his autobiography My Life in Dire Straits in which he confirms that Knopfler has no interest in reforming Dire Straits which he again reiterated in an interview in November 2023. He reflected that the band members had reached the end of the road after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was pretty happy when the bands run came to an end recalling feeling mentally physically and emotionally exhausted by the time Dire Straits disbanded. At the time Illsley also said I can openly admit to you that I really enjoyed the success of the band Im speaking for Mark as well we both really enjoyed it. It comes with a certain amount of stress obviously. Youve got to really dig deep sometimes to keep it working. I think Mark said  and I hope Im quoting him correctly here  but he said that success is great but fame is what comes out of the exhaust pipe of a car. Its something you dont really want.Dire Straits remain one of the most popular British rock bands as well as one of the worlds most commercially successful bands with worldwide album sales of more than 120 million.\n\n1996\u2013present Solo career\nKnopflers first solo album Golden Heart was released in March 1996. It featured the UK single Darling Pretty. The albums recording sessions helped create Knopflers backing band which is also known as The 96ers. It features Knopflers old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This bands main lineup has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits lineup. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christophers Dunblane massacre tribute cover Knockin on Heavens Door.\nKnopfler composed his first film score in 1983 for Local Hero. In 1997, Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie Wag the Dog. During that same year Rolling Stone magazine listed Rock n Roll Hall of Fames 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll which included Sultans of Swing Dire Straits first hit. 2000 saw the release of Knopflers next solo album Sailing to Philadelphia. This has been his most successful to date possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album like Van Morrison. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the Music for Montserrat concert at the Royal Albert Hall London performing alongside artists such as Sting Phil Collins Elton John Eric Clapton and Paul McCartneyIn July 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts under the name of Mark Knopfler and friends with former Dire Straits members John Illsley Chris White Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher playing old material from the Dire Straits years. The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. At these four concerts three of the four were at the Shepherds Bush the fourth at Beaulieu on the south coast they were joined by Jimmy Nail who provided backing vocals for Knopflers 2002 composition Why Aye Man.\nAlso in 2002, Knopfler released his third solo album The Ragpickers Dream. In March 2003 he was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road Belgravia and suffered a broken collarbone broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs. The planned Ragpickers Dream tour was subsequently cancelled but Knopfler recovered and returned to the stage in 2004 for his fourth album ShangriLa.\n\nShangriLa was recorded at the ShangriLa Studio in Malibu California in 2004, where the Band had made recordings years before for their documentarymovie The Last Waltz. In the promo for ShangriLa on his official website he said his current lineup of Glenn Worf bass Guy Fletcher keyboards Chad Cromwell drums Richard Bennett guitar and Matt Rollings piano ...play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did.

The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard European Album chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Rock Album chart.\nKnopflers solo live performances can be characterised as relaxedalmost workmanlike. He uses very little stage production other than some lighting effects to enhance the musics dynamics. He has been known to sip tea on stage during live performances. Richard Bennett who has been playing with him on tour since 1996, has also joined in drinking tea with him on stage. On 31 July 2005, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver BC the tea was replaced with whisky as a last show of tour sort of jokeIn February 2009, Knopfler gave an intimate solo concert at the Garrick Club in London.

In 1988 he formed countryfocused band the Notting Hillbillies with Guy Fletcher Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album Missing..Presumed Having a Good Time was released in 1990 and featured the minor hit single Your Own Sweet Way. Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences with his collaboration with Chet Atkins Neck and Neck which was also released in 1990. Poor Boy Blues taken from that collaboration peaked at No. 92.\nKnopflers other contributions include writing and playing guitar on John Andersons 1992 single When It Comes to You from his album Seminole Wind.

In its review of Dire Straits Brothers in Arms in 1985, Spin commented Mark Knopfler may be the most lyrical of all rock guitarists. In the same year Rolling Stone commended his evocative guitar style. According to Classic Rock in 2018, The bareboned economy of Knopflers songs and his dizzying guitar fills were a breath of clean air amid the lumbering rock dinosaurs and onedimensional punk thrashers of the late 70s. He was peerless as craftsman and virtuoso able to plug into rocks classic lineage and bend it to sometimes wild forms. He wrote terrific songs too taut minidramas of dark depths and dazzling melodic and lyrical flourishes. Knopfler is also well known for playing fingerstyle exclusively something he attributed to Chet Atkins.\n\nPersonal life\nKnopfler has been married three times first to Kathy White his longtime girlfriend from school days. They separated before Knopfler moved to London to join Brewers Droop in 1973. Knopflers second marriage in November 1983 to Lourdes Salomone produced twin sons who were born in 1987.

Included in the auction was the 1983 Les Paul used for hits like Money For Nothing and Brothers In Arms.

In 1984, he formed Big Audio Dynamite with Don Letts. Jones has played with the band CarbonSilicon along with Tony James formerly of Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik since 2002 and was part of the Gorillaz live band for a world tour in 2010\u20132011. In late 2011, Jones collaborated with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form the Justice Tonight Band.\n\nEarly life\nMichael Geoffrey Jones was born on 26 June 1955 in Wandsworth London England to a Welsh father Tommy Jones and a Russian Jewish mother Renee Zegansky. He spent much of his early life living with his maternal grandmother Stella Class who was born in 1899 to Jewish parents in Russia and escaped the Russian pogroms by migrating to the United Kingdom. Jones cousin is Grant Shapps the Conservative MP for Welwyn Hatfield. Jones went to Strand School in south London and the West London School of Art And Design because he thought thats how you get into bands and stuff.\nBut even before the New York Dolls I used to follow bands around. I followed Mott the Hoople up and down the country. Id go to Liverpool or Newcastle or somewheresleep on the Town Hall steps and bunk the fares on the trains hide in the toilet when the ticket inspector came around. Id jump off just before the train got to the station and climb over the fence. It was great times and I always knew I wanted to be in a band and play guitar. That was it for me.\nHe started gaining recognition as a guitarist in the early 1970s with his glam rock band the Delinquents. A short time later he met Tony James and formed the protopunk band London SS. By 1976, that band had broken up and remaining members Jones Paul Simonon and Keith Levene were seeking a new direction.\n\nThe Clash\nWhen he was 21, he and Paul Simonon were introduced to Joe Strummer by Bernie Rhodes in a squat in Shepherds Bush. The band rehearsed in a former railway warehouse in Camden Town and the Clash was formed. Jones played lead guitar sang and cowrote songs from the bands inception until he was fired by Strummer and Simonon in 1983. One of the songs he wrote Train in Vain was allegedly about Jones relationship with Viv Albertine guitarist of the Slits. Jones lack of punctuality played a major role in his dismissal from the band.  Jones agreed to give a rare interview about the disintegration of the Clash and the reasons behind his dismissal from his own band in Danny Garcias 2012 documentary film and book The Rise and Fall of the ClashFor his time with the Clash Jones along with the rest of the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.\nWhile promoting the bands 2013 box set Sound System which Jones says will be the final time he works on Clash music he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummers deathThere were a few moments at the time I was up for it Hall of Fame reunion in 2003) Joe was up for it. Paul wasnt. And neither probably was Topper Headon who didnt wind up even coming in the end. It didnt look like a performance was going to happen anyway. I mean you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point so we didnt. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us we became friends again after the group broke up and continued that way for the rest of the time. That was more important to us than the band.\nIn an October 2013 interview with BBC Radio 6 Music Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and in fact new music was being written for a possible studio album. In the months prior to Strummers death Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros studio album. Jones said We wrote a batch  we didnt use to write one we used to write a batch at a time  like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. Id come in all night and wed all work all night. Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album.\n\nGeneral Public\nAfter his expulsion from the Clash Jones was a founding member of General Public with vocalists Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger of the Beat. Though he is listed in the credits of the bands 1984 debut studio album All the Rage as a member Jones left General Public part way through the recording process and was replaced by Kevin White. Whites picture appears on the back cover Jones picture does not. Jones did play guitar on many of the albums tracks however including the North American top 40 single Tenderness.\n\nBig Audio Dynamite\nLeaving General Public behind in 1984 Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director Don Letts who had directed various Clash music videos and later the Clash documentary Westway to the World 2000). The bands debut studio album This Is Big Audio Dynamite was released the following year with the song EMC\u00b2 getting heavy rotation in dance clubs and both singles Medicine Show and EMC2\" charting in the UK.\nFor Big Audio Dynamites second studio album No. 10, Upping St. 1986) Jones reunited with Strummer. Together the two wrote several songs on the album including Beyond the Pale V. Thirteen and Sightsee MC! Strummer also coproduced the album. Their reunion did not last long and following that collaboration the two did not work together again for some time.\nBig Audio Dynamites third studio album Tighten Up Vol. 88 1988) featured album cover art painted by exClash bassist Paul Simonon. Shortly following its release Jones developed chickenpox and pneumonia and spent several months in hospital. After his recovery Jones released one more studio album with Big Audio Dynamite Megatop Phoenix 1989) before reshuffling the lineup renaming the band Big Audio Dynamite II and releasing The Globe 1991) album. The BAD II lineup had an international 1 hit with their song Rush topping the Billboard Modern Rock charts in the US and singles charts in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn 1990, Jones was featured on Aztec Cameras song Good Morning Britain with Roddy Frame.\nThe bands lineup was reshuffled again in 1994, and they released the studio album Higher Power 1994) under the name Big Audio. In 1995, a greatest hits album Planet BAD. was released as well as a studio album called FPunk under the original Big Audio Dynamite name. A further studio album Entering a New Ride was recorded in 1997, but was only released on the internet because of a disagreement with Radioactive Records their then record label. One more best of collection called Super Hits was released in 1999.\nJones announced the reuniting of Big Audio Dynamite in January 2011, and they performed at the Lollapalooza music festival in 2011.\n\nRecent projects\nCarbonSilicon\nIn 2002, Jones teamed up with his former London SS colleague Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik member Tony James to form a new band named CarbonSilicon. The band has toured the United Kingdom and the United States and has performed a number of antifascist benefit concerts they have also recorded four studio albums ATOM 2006) Western Front 2006) The Crackup Suite 2007)  and The Carbon Bubble 2009) which were available online for free. Their first physical CD release was The News EP. The band encourages their fans to share their music on P2P networks and allow the audio and video taping of their shows. Their first song MPFree is an anthem for P2P file sharing.\nSimilar in many respects to Jones earlier work in Big Audio Dynamite CarbonSilicon aims to break the traditional approach to rock and roll. The band was described by Alan McGee as ...the Stones jamming with a laptop and they make use of samples in their recordings and live shows. The formation of the band was catalysed by the internet and P2P file sharing. The first song written by Jones and James was entitled MPFree in which they expressed their willingness to embrace the technology of the internet and file sharing in the interest of spreading music rather than profit.\nOn seven consecutive Friday nights in January and February 2008 CarbonSilicon played a series of gigs at the Inn on the Green right under the Westway in Thorpe Close between Ladbroke Grove and Portobello Road London. As well as CarbonSilicon there were many special guests including appearances by Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Glen Matlock former Clash drummer Topper Headon and multiinstrumentalist and former Mescalero Tymon Dogg.\n\nProducer\nJones has also been an occasional producer. In 1981, he produced Ellen Foleys second studio album Spirit of St. Louis. Jones was in a relationship with Foley and cowrote songs for the album with Strummer and Tymon Dogg. Players on the album included members of the Blockheads Tymon Dogg and all four members of the ClashIn 1981, Jones coproduced Ian Hunters studio album Short Back n Sides with Mick Ronson. He also provided guitars and vocals for several songs on the release. In the same year he produced Theatre of Hates debut studio album Westworld released in 1982, written by Kirk Brandon. Jones also played guitar on the title track Do You Believe in the Westworld. Jones would also record and produce Aria of the Devil in 1982 by Theatre of Hate at Wessex Studios which did not get released until 1998, when the master tapes were found by Kirk BrandonJones is also credited with contributing guitar and vocals to Mal Bicho the lead track of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs tenth studio album Rey Azucar 1995).He produced the Londonbased band the Libertines debut studio album Up the Bracket 2002) Jones stayed on to produce the bands second studio album The Libertines 2004).

The band headlined the 2010 Coachella Festival Glastonbury Festival and Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim. Jones later appeared on the Gorillazs fourth studio album The Fall 2010) on the track Amarillo.\n\nThe Justice Tonight Band\nIn late 2011, Jones agreed to play songs by the Clash live again collaborating with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form the Justice Tonight Band. The band formed with the aim of promoting awareness of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. The Justice Tonight band have been joined onstage at different gigs by several other musicians sympathetic to the cause including Billy Bragg and Paul Simonon. Shane MacGowan joined them onstage in Phoenix Park when the Justice Tonight Band supported the Stone Roses as part of their Reunion Tour on 5 July 2012.\n\nThe Wallflowers\nJones collaborated with alternative rock group the Wallflowers as a guitarist and backing vocals for two tracks on their sixth studio album Glad All Over 2012).\n\nRachid Taha\nJones was a featured guest on Rachid Tahas ninth and final studio album Zoom 2013) together with Brian Eno and toured with Taha as part of the Zoom project.\n\nThe Flaming Lips\nJones narrated the Flaming Lips fifteenth studio album Kings Mouth released on 20 April 2019 which is Record Store Day.

The Junior was his main guitar up until late 1977 or early 1978, and after that as a backup and studio guitar. Around the same time he also owned another Les Paul Junior all black formerly red with a black pickguard which was smashed at a performance in 1977. He then switched to a Gibson Les Paul Standard and later to Gibson Les Paul Custom.\nJones also occasionally played an Olympic White Fender Stratocaster for live versions of Straight to Hell and several Bond Electraglide guitars that were donated to him by Andrew Bond who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger an analog delay and a noise gate as well as a Roland chorus or Space Echo effect. During his days with the Clash Jones used a Marshall Plexi amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a MesaBoogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.\n\nCameos\nDuring the karaoke club scene in the film Code 46 2003) Jones is seen singing the Clash song Should I Stay or Should I Go.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nCarbonSilicon official website\nMick Jones at AllMusic\nMick Jones discography at Discogs \nMick Jones at IMDb", "Susanna Hoffs born January 17, 1959) is an American singer guitarist songwriter author and actress. Hoffs Debbi Peterson and Vicki Peterson founded the Bangles in 1981. They released their first album All Over the Place on Columbia Records in 1984. The groups third album Everything 1988) included the US topten hit In Your Room and number one Eternal Flame both written by Hoffs with Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Following tensions in the band that included resentment at Hoffs being perceived as the bands leader the group split in 1989. The Bangles reformed in 1999 and released albums in 2003 and 2011.\nHoffs appeared in the films Stony Island 1978) and The Haircut 1982) both written by her mother Tamar Simon Hoffs. She starred in the comedy movie The Allnighter 1987) directed by her mother which was a commercial and critical failure.  Her first solo album When Youre a Boy 1991) was followed by Susanna Hoffs 1996). Neither of the releases proved to be as popular as the Bangles albums although they yielded two charting singles in the US the Top40 hit My Side of the Bed and All I Want. She later recorded several songs for movies and formed the faux British 1960s band Ming Tea with Mike Myers and Matthew Sweet which performed in all three Austin Powers movies. Hoffs teamed with Sweet to produce three albums of cover songs. Her next solo album Someday 2012) was followed by the cover albums Bright Lights 2021) and The Deep End 2023).\nHoffs first novel This Bird Has Flown a romantic comedy about a struggling musician was published by Little Brown in 2023. It received favorable reviews and Universal Pictures purchased the rights to the novel for a screen adaptation.\n\nEarly life\nSusanna Lee Hoffs was born in Los Angeles California on January 17, 1959. She is the daughter of film directorwriterproducer Tamar Ruth n\u00e9e Simon and Joshua Allen Hoffs a psychoanalyst. She is the couples only daughter they also have two sons John and Jesse. She described the home environment as an atheist intellectual creative world. Her maternal grandfather was a rabbi in Chicago. Hoffs visited Israel for the first time at the age of 12 to visit her grandparentsHoffs learned ballet as a child and started playing guitar in elementary school learning chords from her uncle. She attended Palisades High School and received a bachelors degree in art in 1980 from the University of California Berkeley where she switched majors between dance theater film and art. While in college she worked as a production assistant and made her acting debut as part of a cast that included Richie Davis Rae Dawn Chong and Dennis Franz in the 1978 film Stony Island directed by Andrew Davis and cowritten by Hoffs mother Tamar Simon Hoffs. With college friends she attended the final Sex Pistols show at Winterland Ballroom and a Patti Smith concert which inspired her to pursue a career in music.\n\nEarly career\nThe Psychiatrists and the Unconscious\nIn the late 1970s while Hoffs was a student at UC Berkeley she and thenboyfriend David Roback a former schoolmate from Palisades High School formed the duo the Psychiatrists later changing their name to the Unconscious. In one account Hoffs said that the shortlived group would perform for 50 minutes to reflect the duration of psychiatrists hours yet in a 2012 interview when Hoffs was asked when she first performed in front of people she replied that she had a band with David Roback in Berkeley but they never performed for anybody.  She said that the first real performance was with the Bangles and they played at the Laird Movie Studio.\n\nThe Bangs\nThere are different accounts of how Hoffs met the other musicians who became the Bangles. Hoffs either posted an ad in a local newspaper and left flyers at the Whisky a Go Go at a GoGos concert in search of potential bandmates or Hoffs answered a similar ad asking for musicians to join a group. In the second scenario the woman who advertised had previously been in a group with sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson and shared a house with them. Hoffs elected to form a group with the Petersons rather than with the original advertiser and they started the band in Hoffs parents garage in Brentwood which had been refurbished as an apartment for HoffsThe band was originally called the Colours but changed it to the Supersonic Bangs after Hoffs saw an article about 1960s hairstyles in an old copy of Esquire and subsequently to the Bangs. Hoffs said that the group liked the doubleentendre of the name and that you can read a lot into it. There was something kind of gutsy about it. Meanwhile Annette Zilinskas joined as the bass player alongside Hoffs on rhythm guitar Vicki Peterson on lead guitar and Debbie Peterson on drums. The groups musical influences included the Beatles the Beach Boys and the Hollies. Hoffs and the Petersons shared lead vocals. They played at venues in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley and recorded Getting Out of Hand which they released on their own label Downkiddie in 1981, pressing 1,000 copies. In a 1987 Rolling Stone interview Susan Orlean described the bands early audiences as mostly boys who appreciated their toughenough music and playfully flirtatious stage presence. Author James Dickerson later characterized the groups loyal audience as made up of horny highschool and collegeage males who relished their inyourface sexuality and commented that the musicians had gained their success through their own efforts without intervention from any man.\n\nThe Bangles\nMiles Copeland of IRS. Records saw the Bangs at a show and signed them to his Faulty Products label. He had previously signed another group of women the GoGos whose albums had been commercially successful. In 1982, following a legal claim by another group called the Bangs Hoffs and her bandmates changed their name again to the Bangles. Meanwhile Faulty Products folded and bands selftitled EP was eventually released on IRS. Records in 1982. In 1983, the group signed to Columbia Records and Zilinskas left and was replaced by Michael Steele. Meanwhile Hoffs played a role in the short comedy film The Haircut 1982) starring John CassavetesThe Bangles released their first full album All Over the Place in 1984 on Columbia Records it was acclaimed by critics but sold poorly. Their breakthrough hit was the 1986 single Manic Monday written by Prince which reached number two on the US charts. This single was released as a track on the album Different Light 1986) which was warmly received by critics and went doubleplatinum in 1987, then tripleplatinum in 1994. Walk Like an Egyptian from the same album reached number one in the US in December 1986, and was their first American gold record single. Dickerson wrote that Manic Monday and Walk Like an Egyptian opened the door to a new audience of female fans widening the groups appeal out from a predominantly male fanbase. Hoffs first met Prince in 1984, and the pair spoke regularly. He attended some of the groups concerts and occasionally appeared on stage with them. Paul Evans and Ernesto Lechner of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide 2004) opined that Hoffs had mastered a singing style that combined pep coy sweetness and an occasional plaintive resonance.During the video for Walk Like an Egyptian there is a closeup of Hoffs face where she moves her eyes from side to side. Hoffs recounted that she had been looking at selected members of the crowd to counter stage fright and had not realized it would be a focal point in the video. Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote of the scene But its so cool. It makes her look like shes up to some mischief. The television director Marty Callner later said I saw situations where one shot would make a star like with Susanna Hoffs and Walk Like an Egyptian. That thing she did with her eyes. In 2011, Hoffs was quoted as saying I guess its become an iconic moment in that video and I didnt even realize it was happening.A 1986 London performance by the Bangles was reviewed by David Sinclair of The Times who felt that the band proved unconvincing in performance although Hoffs was by and large the best at creating a mood of emotional involvement. Her clear fragile voice and coquettish enunciation were reminiscent of Stevie Nicks. Writing in the same paper a few months later Richard Williams also compared Hoffs to Nicks writing that Hoffs dark eyes dangerous pout and fancifully sexy costumes match her sultry voice were reminiscent of the Fleetwood Mac singer and concluding that Hoffs was an equally obvious candidate for a successful solo career one day.The Bangles had another US number two hit with a cover of Simon  Garfunkels A Hazy Shade of Winter released in late 1987 and reaching its peak position in February 1988. Following a successful tour the group issued their third and final Columbia album Everything in 1988. The first single In Your Room cowritten by Hoffs with Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly became a US top 10 hit. The same album included their second US number one and second American gold record single Eternal Flame which was also cowritten by Hoffs Steinberg and Kelly. Hoffs sang the studio recording of Eternal Flame naked due to producer Davitt Sigerson pranking her by telling her Olivia NewtonJohn had done the same thing. He later told Hoffs he had just been pulling her leg. As the studio was dark and Hoffs was standing behind a sound baffle she could not be seen.\nHoffs was lead vocalist on five of the seven Columbia singles by the Bangles. This and an expectation that groups would have a primary vocalist contributed to a public perception that she was a lead singer even though all four members took lead vocals across their output and Steele and Peterson did most of the talking between songs in concert. As Hoffs was significantly shorter than the other band members photographs of the group tended to feature her at the front. Additionally she had appeared as lead in the movie The Allnighter 1987) and was known to have Princes attention. Orlean wrote that the cumulative effect was to vault Susanna into beyondBangles celebrity status.In 1989, while still popular the Bangles disbanded to undertake individual projects. There had been tensions and disquiet in the group since the Different Light they saw themselves as musical creators but their biggest successes had been versions of songs written by others. The public perception of Hoffs as bandleader took a toll on group harmony. In an interview for a 2002 book Hoffs pinpointed the stress of touring as the breaking point. In her account she recalled that the band members were tired and reluctant to tour but agreed to do so at the behest of their management and record company and in response to demand from their fans. According to the books authors Lee Miller and Jessica Miller The situation deteriorated so badly that they canceled the tour abruptly and the band split up. Susanna always blamed the stress of that final tour for the breakup.Hoffs contacted the other members of the Bangles in the late 1990s with the hope of reuniting. In 2008, she told Andrew Murfett of The Age that I wanted to do new Bangles music. I was driving the other girls crazy calling them. I didnt want to be a greatest hits band. I wanted to write and sing new songs. That was really important to Vicki and Debbie too. We didnt want to go on a Ladies of the 1980s tour. The reunited Bangles played at a Beatles tribute concert conducted by George Martin and recorded the single Get the Girl for the second Austin Powers movie in 1999. Subsequently they announced their decision to reunite fulltime in 2000. Hoffs recounted that following the experiences that led to the group disbanding in 1989, the band members agreed that each would have a veto on the groups proposed activities. Their fourth album Doll Revolution was released in 2003; despite positive reviews it sold moderately well. The group embarked on a tour following its release. Their fifth album Sweetheart of the Sun was released in 2011; it received an average score of 69 on review aggregator site Metacritic indicating Generally favorable reviews.Evans and Lechner felt that the band achieved gigantically the dubious triumph of sound over significance and of the inevitable reunion that even nostalgia has its limits. However Robert Christgau rated all of the albums from their first incarnation as B or above and gave Doll Revolution three stars.\n\nSolo career\nHoffs contributed lead vocals to covers of Bob Dylans Ill Keep It with Mine and Lou Reeds Ill Be Your Mirror on Rainy Days album Rainy Day 1984). Led by David Roback the project also included Vicki Peterson and members of other Paisley Underground bands Dream Syndicate the Three OClock and Rain Parade. Ill Keep It with Mine was issued as the Aside of Rainy Days only singleIn 1987, Hoffs starred in the comedy The Allnighter directed by Tamar Simon Hoffs which also featured Joan Cusack and Pam Grier. Glenn Kenny wrote in Video Review that Hoffs character was full of spunk like her Bangles persona but less savvy concluding that the movie was unextraordinary and inoffensive. New York Times critic Janet Maslin panned the movie as outstandingly dim. The film was also dismissed by Richard Harrington in The Washington Post who declared that Hoffs makes an inauspicious leap from rock videos to the big screen shes stiff and selfconscious. The movie was commercially unsuccessful Susanna Hoffs said she expected it to fare better as a home video as the production was more suitable for home than cinema viewing. Hoffs later told journalist Chris Hunt that It was such a low budget quickie thing a cutesy little teenybopper movie. It wasnt a great movie but the whole experience of it was great.In 1991, Hoffs released her first postBangles solo album When Youre a Boy. It begins with the Billboard Top 40 single My Side of the Bed which also charted in the UK at No. 44).  It includes the track Unconditional Love and ends with a cover of Boys Keep Swinging the 1979 song written by David Bowie and Brian Eno. The album received a negative critical reception and did not sell well. One upbeat assessment was provided by Alan Neister of The Globe and Mail who found the album as good as the Bangles best work and added that Both as a songwriter and a song consumer Hoffs has an ear finetuned to a great hook and there isnt a song on this album that isnt hummable on the very first listen. In The Times Sinclair felt that with the exception of the Bowie cover the album was an airbrushed exercise in boredom. the album was rated as a dud by Christgau. Jimmy Nicol of Q Magazine gave the album four out of five stars and wrote An album which expands the Bangles brief into undreamed of territories. She reveals herself to be a highly inventive composer lyricist  and even humourist yet The Encyclopedia of Popular Music 2006) Colin Larkin gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and argued that it failed to maintain the interest of the mainstream fans who had discovered the Bangles in the wake of the smash single Eternal Flame while simultaneously alienating the Paisley Underground loyalists with its AOR clich\u00e9s. The Trouser Press Record Guide entry by Ira Robbins panned the album as a noholdsbarred commercial bore.Prior to leaving Columbia Records Hoffs recorded tracks with producer Matt Wallace for a followup album in 1993\u201394  including some songs written by Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse  but the album was not releasedHer second solo album Susanna Hoffs was issued on London Records in 1996. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised it as an infectious and engaging set of melodic pop that also happens to be Hoffs most introspective and personal record to date. Wook Kim of Entertainment Weekly remarked that Hoffs performs a small act of bravery yet Larkin wrote that only one song King Of Tragedy had the edgy pop fizz of the Bangles best work. Billboard reviewed the single Only Love writing Energetic and harmonious ditty recalls heyday of 60sera girl groups.  Lots of fun.Hoffs covered the Oingo Boingo song We Close Our Eyes for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer film soundtrack in 1992, and provided the title song for the 1995 film Now and Then. She also recorded her versions of Burt Bacharach songs for the soundtracks of two Austin Powers films  The Look of Love appears on the soundtrack of the first movie in 1997, Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and Alfie is on the soundtrack of the third Austin Powers in Goldmember. Hoffs also contributed covers of The Water Is Wide and Donovans Catch the Wind for the soundtrack of Tamar Simon Hoffs 2003 film Red Roses and PetrolHoffs selfreleased her third solo album of new material and her first full album since 1996) Someday on her Baroque Folk label on July 17, 2012.  It was distributed by Vanguard Records. American Songwriter gave Someday a rating of 45 out of 5 stars and described it as easily and undeniably Hoffs most definitive musical statement to date. James Reed from the Boston Globe wrote Someday reminds you that Hoffs is perfectly suited to sunny winsome material ... her performance on Someday isnt that removed from how she sounded on say Eternal Flame. The tracks include a newly recorded version of November Sun which Hoffs had initially recorded for another unrealized album project in 2000. Produced by Mitchell Froom the album is influenced by the music of the 1960s and features Davey Faragher and Pete Thomas from Elvis Costellos band the Imposters and keyboards and orchestration by Froom. Larkin commented that The Bangles folded in 1989 partly because Susanna Hoffs was being touted as the star in a previously egalitarian band. It is ironic therefore that her solo career failed to come close to the success enjoyed by her old band.Hoffs contributed vocals to One Voice the end credits song for the film A Dog Named Gucci 2016) a track also featuring Norah Jones Aimee Mann Lydia Loveless Neko Case Brian May and Kathryn Calder. One Voice was released on Record Store Day April 16, 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities.\nIn 2021, Baroque Folk Records released Bright Lights Hoffs fourth studio album. The record was produced by Paul Bryan and features versions of songs by Nick Drake Michael Nesmith Richard Thompson Pete Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger and othersongwriters. The album includes Name of the Game featuring Aimee Mann.  Jonathan Keefe of In Review Online wrote Hoffs is in fantastic voice throughout the album and praised the versatility of her renditionsIn 2023, Hoffs released her fifth solo album The Deep End  produced by Peter Asher  The album includes interpretations of the Rolling Stones Squeeze Lesley Gore and received favorable reviews Lily Moayeri of Spin Magazine wrote Hoffs voice is immediately recognizable clear and sweet hitting all the notes she did some 40 years ago. But her singular interpretations are so unique they sometimes render the songs unrecognizablein a good way. Gary Graff of Ultimate Classic Rock wrote that the album was a delight a demonstration of good taste and guts with Hoffs sounding as beguiling as she did lighting Eternal Flame or having a Manic Monday more than 30 years ago.In addition to cowriting for the Bangles Hoffs has cowritten songs for the GoGos Belinda Carlisle and Bette Midler.  She has contributed vocals on albums by such artists as Talking Heads Rufus Wainwright Travis and the Lilith Fair Celebration of Music compilation album with Sarah McLachlin Shawn Colvin Emmylou Harris and others.

Other critics that commented positively about the book included Mark Weingarten in the Los Angeles Times Michael Schaub of NPR and from Kirkus Reviews. Universal Pictures purchased the rights to the novel for a screen adaptation.\n\nOther collaborations\nMing Tea\nMike Myers musician Matthew Sweet and Hoffs formed the core of the fauxBritish 60s band Ming Tea after Myers left Saturday Night Live in the early 1990s. With Myers developing the Austin Powers character hed created and with Hoffs pausing her solo career they first met to play informally and all adopted pseudonyms for the band  Sweet became Sid Belvedere and Hoffs became Gillian Shagwell. The trio made a number of club and TV performances and Myers thenwife Robin Ruzan encouraged him to write a film based on the character. The result was Austin Powers International Man of Mystery directed by Hoffs husband Jay Roach. Ming Tea appeared in all three Austin Powers films and recorded the songs BBC and Daddy Wasnt There for two of the soundtrack albums. Hoffss recording of The Look of Love appeared in the film and on the soundtrack for Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and her recording of Alfie Whats It All About Austin appeared in the film and on the soundtrack for Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nWith Matthew Sweet\nHoffs teamed with Sweet as Sid and Susie to record several cover versions of classic rock songs from the 1960s for their album Under the Covers Vol. 1 2006). Hoffs and Sweet released a followup Under the Covers Vol. 2 in 2009, featuring songs from the 1970s by Fleetwood Mac Carly Simon Rod Stewart and others. Under the Covers Vol. 3 was released in 2013, featuring cover songs from the 1980s the decade when both of their careers began the album included covers of songs by the Smiths Pretenders and Roxy Music. In 2013, Hoffs collaborated with Sweet and Tim Robbins on a recording of the traditional song Marianne for the sea shantythemed compilation Son of Rogues Gallery Pirate Ballads Sea Songs  Chanteys.\n\nEquipment\nBefore joining college Hoffs started playing electric guitar initially a Gibson SG. She decided to seek out a Rickenbacker because she liked the really jangly bright sound and because the Byrds and the Beatles had used the brand and purchased a 1960s model with black and white checked binding. She used this on the early Bangles recordings but after some work on the guitar that affected its feel she bought a Rickenbacker 325. On the cover of All Over the Place Hoffs is depicted holding her Rickenbacker 325V63 guitar. Musicologist Peter MercerTaylor observed that it was a black and white 6-string with three pickups and a hole for a vibrato bar though the bar is not in place. Shortly after its 1963 appearance this had become John Lennons signature instrument. MercerTaylor considered this a powerful metaphor that showed the group were intent on carrying the female ensemble into artistic terrain from which they had long been forbidden. Although Hoffs employed the 325 on some of the bands recordings she found it hard to tune and said that it ended up being more of a video guitar. For some time her main instrument was a borrowed Fender Telecaster and she also used a Fender Stratocaster including for live shows in 1984 and 1985) two Rickenbacker 350s and two Rickenbacker 620/12s obtained during the Different Light sessions and a Fritz Brothers Roy Buchanan Bluesmaster. \nShe contributed to the design of a Susanna Hoffs model of the Rickenbacker 350 which the company released in 1988 and 1989. After the dissolution of the Bangles Hoffs had a Taylor K22; she later worked with Taylor on the Susanna Hoffs Signature Series of guitars. She also has a 1966 12-string Guild Starfire which she felt provided an incredible brightbutwarm sound and used for tracks on Doll Revolution.\n\nPersonal life\nHoffs married filmmaker Jay Roach in 1993, and they have two sons. Roach converted to Judaism when they married. Hoffs inspired the songs The Girl with the Guitar Says Oh Yeah by the Three OClock and That Bangle Girl by Robbie Fulks.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSingles\nEPs\nOther appearances\nFilmography\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBooks and journal articles\n\nAbbey Cherie D Hillstrom Kevin 2004).
